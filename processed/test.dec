Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No.
Hopefully.
What do you think?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Why?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
It's just a party. Daddy.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Her favorite uncle
Okay!  I wasn't sure
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
What?
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William didn't even go to high school
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Just let me sit down.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Go to the prom with me
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
You decided.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Parts of it.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Hi.
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Make anyone cry today?
Did I have anything to say about it?
That ' s what I thought
We'll all go crazy...
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
May I ask by whom?
No?
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
You'll always be older than me, Father.
New worlds create new people.
That she was impregnable.
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
We're lost!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You're right.  Let the men decide.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
What's your cut?  How much?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Can I see your back?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
No.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
But Chief?  Over this??
What was that, Korfin?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
What are you saying?
Describe him.
Pretty.
Mind if I ride along with you?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Raw deal.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
What do you want?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Yeah.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
See you later.  Good luck.
Jesus Christ.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where is escort service?
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Sit down!
Be quiet.  Watch.
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
I'm trying to tell you.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Excuse me?
He's my collar!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Yeah?  What kind?
What the hell happened?
The clerk?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Roger.
Yes, I know.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
Yes, it is.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
How many days until you come home?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
How is gregor?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
How about chargin' the battery?
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Bullshit.
I may call you worse than that.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
How much?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
You sure that's the reason?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
How did they get away?
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
One of  em's in the slam.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
That's the way I see it, too.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What do you want?
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
This ain't a credit business.
Try and take it.
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
You noticed...
Of course.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Do you love her?
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
So, just how big was this fare?
Vito Cornelius?
You have nine points left on your license..
Found it?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
To save the world.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Uh..
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Do you know how much I missed you?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
I just talked to her.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
Call me Tom.
Why don't they come to me?
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is this.
How'd you find me here?
Who is Machine?
I told you, I don't know.
What did you do with her body?
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Easy enough for you.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
You'll get it when we get there.
I'll risk it.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
You're learning.
It's their Presidential Suite.
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I try to be.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
No.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Why do you think he did it?
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
No.
What?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Will you let me look?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Those are her belongings.
None too discreet, is he?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Kristen's story really got to her.
Earth to Alice...
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
My name is...
How did you know that?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
My undying love.  Have some.
I can't listen to this.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Helen.  I appeal to you -
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
What about down?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Why do you say that?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Huh?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
I'll be another!
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Guaranteed, eh?
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Not here.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
You stayed away?
What blood?
I don't care. They're out.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
No.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
I'm not saying that.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Something bugging you?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Could be.
Mel Gordon.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
You've been married twice --
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Wade.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
How's that?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
He got his deer yet?
You no-good pup!
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
No shit.
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Get some sleep.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I'm sure he's busy.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Hey, you guys back already?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
You read my mind.
We don't know that.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Copy, Air Force One.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Come on, Alice.
My husband is a very courageous man.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Thank you for calling the white House...
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes I did...
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted!
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
That was very well put, Ted.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Yeah.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
He's carrying a bomb.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Who wants to be first?
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Every day.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
My wife?  She worries about me.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Why?
Stop the car!
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
For you, anything.
What's that?
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Did he find anything?
Don't tell me what to think.
It is. 
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
She's right.
Bullshit!
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Dead on all channels.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Alive?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
You promise?
I'm sorry, Newt.
Right here, baby.  Right here.
Indeed.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Yes!
What are you talking about?
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No!
Eat
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
Wolfi.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Oh, Stanzi.
Why not?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Madame. How can I help you?
Really?
What?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
Where's our friend?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Hey!
Behold!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Who was your teacher?
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
And German?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Would you tell me why?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Am I not welcome?
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
Pupils?
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Good morning, sir.
Bene! Bene!
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Is he working?
Are you sure it's an opera?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Wolfi!
What?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
How could I not?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Who?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Strange!
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Then you must know this.
I regret it is not too familiar.
And do they believe it?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Yes?
Yes.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
What do you mean - now?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Can we come in?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Yes, Doctor?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
Warn him?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
It was a wolf.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Lovely.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
But, David.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Don't you remember?
David, let's go now.
I thought not.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Now see here young man.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
I really don't know.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
You ask them.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I can't stand it.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Nurse!
A monster. I know, I know.
Jack, are you really dead?
I will not accept this! Now go away!
Thank you.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
How shall I do it?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
You here again? What do you want?
I want to know why .
Yes - sure—
Where's Matt?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
What good will that do?
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
You understand?
Fifty thousand dollars!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I haven't got it.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Good for you. Come on.
What are you doing here?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Hello, darling.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Yes, sir.
All right. Send him in.
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Got my letter?
Why, I don't know.
Sure, I think it's swell.
There you are.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Well . . . ?
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Never a good thing.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
He's planning a job.
What?
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What is wrong with you?
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Sadie was not a man!
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Shit.
Died a hero.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
I figure.
You've killed your fair share of men.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Got any ideas, little brother?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
You didn't want to farm?
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
That's the idea.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Pity.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Damn.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
You cocky little bastard.
Fair enough.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Communion.
You been with a girl ever?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Lyla Devereux.
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Good.
Just perfect.
THEN WHO DID?!
What is going on here, man?
What, sir?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
This is no game.
It is a nice piece of writing.
Can't you tell me anything?
Vengeance.
Stop it. I'm...
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
You like it there, don't you?
Is it a what?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
I'm just leaving.
There was no ad in the Times.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Patrick?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Thanks, Patrick.
Can you bring Mr...
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Why?
No. Flattering, but no.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
No. I'm okay.
It's no problem
Understandable.  Lime?
No, I guess it's okay.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Not a big music fan, eh?
But Marcus denied it?
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
Speak up. Come on.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
You know what I mean.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Milo! What about --?
Isn't that -- extreme?
They hack into people's programs?
...Whaddo I do?
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Don't we have any chopsticks?
You're just afraid to eat it.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
We tried!
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Right... Right.
Nothing!
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
You've been coming in early.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
She saved my life.
Oh yeah?
He's out of prison?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
What?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You'll come up with something.
Is that how Larry feels?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Speaking of which...
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Or sometimes not at all.
To my health.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Smashing!
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Oh, and Austin...
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
I beg your pardon?
My wedding tackle.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
I'm sure.
I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
You know who.
Fair enough.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Sure.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's its current position?
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Why?
What about his teeth?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... head ...
Secret ...
Fear ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Sir August...?  What now?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
So am I.
'Our revels now are ended.'
No thanks.
I might say the same.
Why should they think that?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Barely.
Orders.
Nothing personal.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
You'll find out.
What kept you?
Peter's brother?  But --
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Dead, I'm afraid.
Why?
She may try to kill you.
You.
Guilty until proven innocent?
You wish.
I do.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
When do the girls get to the party?
Mr. Thomerson.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
No, Cole, I...
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, we don't really know that.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
What's going on?
I'll take some.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
It's all right...  So have I.
Then it's on to the real thing.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
I'm proud of you, lad.
What's with her costume?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
That was never proved.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Fuck you.
Saw what?
They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Then who --
Sure you do.
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
But the right guess on this is arson.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But he killed these guys.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Yeah.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
Four months?
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He's out.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
I want 15 on the Mets.
This psycho can.
Yes, Sister?
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Ho!
Let's go NIGGERS.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Please.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
She's also moorish.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Look at my lips.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
How you sound?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I'm wid it.
Yep, you guessed it.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
We think so.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
It's been a long time.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Your father is proud of you.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You getting cold feet?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
This is Cheeba.
Hello.
How so?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
I feel fine.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
It looks delicious.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...not that time...
...like grits and butter...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
We can look out for ourselves.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
It must have been some other gate.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Then you yield to me.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Have you not a man whom you value?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Old fool!
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Dark Valdez.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Shut up.  West's dead.
You did Basic here?
Okay.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
But not Pike's.
We've found all of them.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
There were six of us...
The creek bed --
Would you have believed me?
How do you know that?
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
I...
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Why?
But not the only victim, right?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
No. I said Dunbar.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Maybe --
What kind of trouble are you in?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Tell me what I can do.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
What about the confession?
What are you talking about?
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
Get your hands away from the desk!
Good cop/bad cop?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
I lost a bet.
What point?
Dunbar.
They got their stories straight.
You couldn't have known --
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
So did I.
I don't think I want to hear this --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Oh, you remember now --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Wait --
Wrong answer --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
There's only one I want.
Edward Bloom.
I'll...
Go.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
That's terrible.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I like your stories.
Make him stop.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
You're right.
I will.
You know where the chemicals are?
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
What?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I wasn't expecting you.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
But it's romantic.
What for?
No I don't.
Yes.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Yeah.
Leave him!
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
You must have a visa or something...
No, no...
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
I don't want to know.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Oh Jesus.
Excuse me?
I don't hate you.
Some... What does that mean?
Get out
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
No.
Not really. Maybe a little.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Yes?
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
You gonna miss your bus.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
LAZ, I said let...!
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
What?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Sure.
I'm here with you.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
You can handle it.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
This Rae... you get with her?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Like I told you.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Why?
-- I should tear your head off.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Maybe we should do something?
Saving your life.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Where is the subway station, please.
Hey, all right.
You'll take care of that.
Give us a break...
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't, that's all.
Why weren't you at the platform?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Are we getting married?
Good.  Very good...
Gaiijin.
Nick --
San is an honorable title.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
A wife.  She left.
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.
You could fake it.
He drinks.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
Tell them I'm not.
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
I'd like that.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Yeah.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Goodbye, officer.
I don't have to.
Where?
Oh?
And what can he do for you?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
He could?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Garbage man?
Got it.
You start.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
These aren't just...
What did she want?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
How do you know I'm not?
I'm tired of this.
What desert?
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I don't have one.
Oh.
We sure did.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Sure.
For how long?
Eve? I'm leaving.
Are you French?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Why doesn't it never work out?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
Who are these people?
What?
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
I don't want to be alone.
Everybody's divorced.
That's what I was afraid of.
Stop that ma'am crap!
Thank-Q!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
I know first aid!
Neat. Goodnight!
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Nothing.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Uh-huh.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
When did we get it from them?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
You don't look thirty-five.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I don't see anything!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Gladly.
How do you do, ma'am.
Good!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yes, ma'am.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
What?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Coming!
Yes.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
What do you think, Adam?
Uh..he might of.
Who did he leave with?
Uh, yes, you do.
He left with Sophie.
I don't know. I like to think so.
We came back to the house!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Um...uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Stand by. One.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Not yet.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Then you got undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
No, please. I won't.
No. What is happening?
Don't say that.
Same here.
Just get outta my bed.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
No.  Hi baby.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Speak to me Fucker.
Yes.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
That sounds great!
Uh-uh.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
That's what I thought.
See ya tomorrow.
You want to go talk to him?
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Frank!!!
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Got it.
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
We're here brother.
Connor, is that you?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
He got beat up by a girl.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
No pictures, either.
Then what the fuck?
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Yeah?
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Witness?
Roc. You okay?
Well, I'm sold.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You believe?
I guess not.
The... The funny man.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Dignan, it's --
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
She's an attractive older woman.
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Because my mom gets the bill.
Look at the treads on those.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
True.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Right here.
This morning.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Don't panic, Anthony.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
He seems pretty good.
I did.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
As a person?
Yes. I do.
Hang on a second.
Where's Kumar?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
You got to be kidding me.
The grandfather clock?
What do you mean?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
God, yes. Like silk.
Feel this.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
No.
You're paranoid, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
Watch me.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Let's go.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Run. Run. Let's go.
Do you have your own cell?
I'm working on it.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
He said you ran away from home.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Well, I think --
What?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Excuse me.
May I finish?
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
No... It must have been Bourne.
Don't know.
The sooner the better.
Keep going...
You killed them.
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
Sorry. Old habits.
Conklin.
I don't know.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- take the back -- get another car --
I'll get the book.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
There's no choice.
Last week? When?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
What do you mean?
Who?
What?
Still...
Who's this?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
I don't want to be a martyr.
Three, maybe more!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
That depends on the man.
We don't split up!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
Let her speak.
It matters not, he is thy king!
You are. And I'll come again.
...Tonight!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
...I wouldn't know.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
I must... consult with my father.
What is it?
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
How long will I be in here?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Like Ozzy.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
I'm sorry.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Those are your clothes, silly.
I walk differently?
What?
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
Stop! Take me back!
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
...yes.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Evan Treborn.
Gee, thanks friend.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I'd better be going.
It's not for sale.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
And I was wondering.
Why there is no other man in my life?
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
It doesn't matter.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
And I said I would never leave you.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
No, Victor, no.
Yes?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Won't you join us for a drink?
Right.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Had a close one, eh?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, I get the point.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Very well.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
A leader, like Laszlo?
A wise foreign policy.
Victor Laszlo?
Okay.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Our expenses?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Then don't have a drink.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
You've had today's water.
Water water water --
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
As much as anybody.
They're harder to do than they look.
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
No.  that was the last one.
So do I.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Not if you work for FedEx.
I can't even keep fish alive.
Could you watch Jango?
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I know.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
Which I didn't have.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Let's eat.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
We're on.
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
That's what it's about.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Dr. Homer Wells.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Good night, Daddy.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
No. She was an immigrant.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Actually, I volunteered.
Right.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I don't think so.
Of course.
Right.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
No trouble.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
I told him that you all is sick.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Everything looks in order.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
Guess so.
I told you, use less powder.
Tonight. Just me.
I'd like this cashed, please.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Because you killed one of my crew.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
No thanks. I'm good.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
It's more than that.
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Sounds respectable.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
No, I want my cut!
Your mess.
Miles...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
Breasts.
We're getting a little old for running.
This is embarrassing.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What?
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Goodnight.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Sorry.
We all played the field.
South African women are very sporty.
Not particularly.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I don't know.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
No. Answer it!
You will?
Nothing about you.
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
Near the casino.
The debts.
I didn't.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
I can't do it, Jani.
I have to take the car.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Who...
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Rough life, Jack.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
Five.
I make it six.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Bruised.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Eventual supernova.
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Oh, God...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Of course.
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
That's it.
I'll check it.
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Any planets?
-- Remark.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Not now!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Sorry.
Talk to the bomb.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Who's Camille?
Leave.  Now.
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
No way.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Girlfriend?
I'm not a half bad cook.
Bent.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
You lost me.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
With your help.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
You did.
Then what?
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
Straight.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A long time.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Please...
So are dogs.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
But there's another side--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Say the words, "I understand."
Shut-up...
He's sick.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Yeah, a man's drink...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Thanks.
Oh, screw it!
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
Yeah.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
One more time in English.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Sure.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
No...
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Yeah.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
What did you say?
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
I don't wanna talk about it.
We never would have had this conversation.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Where it came from?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Frank.
No.  That's stupid.
Do you think a lot about girls?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
Then how is time travel possible?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Her name is Gretchen.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
How did this happen?
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Go back to China, bitch!
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Raspberry.
She's right over there.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh-yah.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
This came for you, sweetie.
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Oh-you-beccha.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Yes, Leslie!
Loretta, shut it.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Okay. Take her purse.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Yeah.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
Is that all?
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Take a letter...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
What kind of a dog is he?
Half watch dog?
I don't wanna work at all.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
She did.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
$50?
Go ahead.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why -- why -- of course.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Oh?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Right... Right.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
Where did you get this box?
John Merrick.
Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
That's a canopy, John.
The children! May I see?
Your mother?
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Well...
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
There IS no one.
But, Father, it IS!
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
Five this week; how many the week before?
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Yes -- I believe you do.
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Is it night or day, Erik?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
I don't suppose... no...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Oh, thanks.
What a stupid idea.
Odin!
Come on, move it!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
What?
I met this girl...
Make your mind up.
ROW!
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Well, come on!
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
Just say something cheerful.
We haven't got a spare place.
Over the Edge of the World.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Well, where is he then?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
Bastard.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
I know, Dad.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Neither am I.
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
I never do...
Sweetie, we called the company.
Yeah.
You did? You liked me?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
In the room?
Oh, Tangerine.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Why?
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Probably see you at the book store.
What?
Very much.
You just say. I'm not really --
Yeah?
I don't know.
I think about that.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I want to know you.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Yeah, maybe.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Tomorrow?
Joel, come here. Please.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
A bully? Moi?
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
I probably got the same thing as you.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I just got in.
Fuck you, Clementine.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
We haven't checked.
It's a good one all right.
Yup.
Where?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
I know what it is.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
The Clock People?
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
I have to go, Julian.
Hitchhiking?
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I heard it.
What about the accumulator...?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
We'll make it.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
Does he know that?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Peters...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
You can't, your orders are specific...
Watch me.
What makes you think I'll miss?
NOOO!
But you can breathe it.
What about the life readings you picked up?
Who?
I've got a theory.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
He served on the Goliath.
Can you see a body?
We're losing atmosphere...
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
1000 meters...
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
It's easy for you to be patient.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Please tell me you go silent too.
Sweet.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Then what is it?
And that's a good thing?
That's what we're here to find out.
Excuse me?
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Arnold. What's happening?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Sis.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Did you get her name?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
No Damone. I don't understand.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Should we buy a frame for that?
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
It was okay.
Not since November.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Not coming? What happened?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
I couldn't make it in time.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Aloha, Spicoli.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Excellent.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
I'll get you the notes.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Yes... It makes sense.
Awake? What do you mean?
Holy shit!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
A major!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Lacerda?
That's what gives me The Fear.
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
They were all veterans.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Do you think you can handle it?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Where's that?
Follow me.
Shit!
Get in line!
The door... on three.
Just an observation.
Well...
Oh, no.
But --
How much I got, what?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
Get outta here.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Wait God-dammit!
All right.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I said I'm not lying.
I just hit it like you said.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Who's this?
I guess so, sir.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
You're afraid!
Come here. I want to show you something.
I know, but --
Without me.
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thank you.
Were you a drug addict?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Kurt!
...Not if I can help it.
Don't touch me.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
You think I'd miss it?
Enh.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What happened to him?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
Yeah.
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Is that why you did it?
I know.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
What's that?
I got your number, Mister Man.
Yeah. I don't know.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
You think I got it?
You got it.
Sure.
No!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Oh bullshit.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Frances, I'm warning you...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
No!
Then why weep for him?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
Kill me and have done with it.
I don't know.
The world is a dizzying place.
And you?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Open this door for no-one!
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Somebody has to!
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
I've been preoccupied.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
You know of it?
Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Good point.
They're off now.
Okay.
I meant everything.
I'll spot you five points.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
I love you.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Umhummmmph.
Whassamatta?
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Sure.
Yeah.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
Scott and Kate.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Why not, against your religion?
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
In the Winnebago.
Ain't it the truth.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
No!
What's in Mexico?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
No.
How do you know?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Really?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
I'm not sure what --
Sir...
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
No shortage of suspects.
What about him.
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
That's not right.
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
No.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
What?
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Only one way to find out.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Sure. I'd like that.
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
What do I get?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Call me Charlie.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Oh, I'm not married.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Where's Luc and Pierre?
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Follow me.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Why do you need that?
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
It's okay. I know her.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Leadership....
"Just!?"
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
THIS much.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
What does the Omega 13 do?
But you don't?
Shit! Go!
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Never mind, Fred....
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
You smiled at me.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
I don't know.
We.. We lie.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
Catch me later, okay?
... Maintenance facility...
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
It's as far as it goes!
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Well... I misunderstood, then.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No.  I guess.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Lafayette will not be happy...
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
If he isn't, then he's stupid.
What's the difference?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
How can you say that?
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
I... they look both the same.
Get these men back in line!
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
That's a lie!
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
George, I'm sorry.
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
You gave him the money?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Who?
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
The airport.
That's the magic number.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Ray. Look at me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Something shouldn't be there.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Never say anything unless you have to.
His shrink's trainer.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Buddy?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Rough day on the set?
I want to know.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You bet.
Go get your stuff.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
With that coxswain dickhead.
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
What're you crazy?
Gimme a break.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Smugglers maybe.
Sounds reasonable.
Threw a turbine blade.
Hard to say.
How long?
Goddamit, Dodge.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Sorry.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
What?
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Only way to be.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Who?
Doesn't matter.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
That much I think we've already established.
Over the gold.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Maybe.
A what?
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
How should I know?
Who?
Maxine.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Uh-oh.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
No.
I guess.
Yeah, right...
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Why not?
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
What? Why?
Why?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you sign up yet?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
You can have that one.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
She says she wants to MMPH!
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Bingo!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What, is she black now?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Fuck you, bitch!
As always.
Everybody's too stupid!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Get away from me!
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
That's all you're bringing?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
It just came yesterday...
Just because.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
Who does?
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Hey, where are you going?
Well why do I care about that?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Okay.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
PLEASE? We have to!
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
That's the spirit!
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Who knows?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Just someone so young...
Can you at least let me in?
What's the matter?
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
Yeah, well I like you too...
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
I will if you want to.
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
But overall, you're pleased?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
What if there are complications?-
-not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.
I assure you we came close many times-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
The workers don't get on?
Good news?
Help finish the railroad.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Hold your son high. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Good luck.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Did I forget something?
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
From where -- Neptune?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Something good --
Oh, Ray --
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
She's new in town.
No, I just thought --
Wonder what?
Well, thanks a lot.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Are you all right?
I'll scream.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I see.
Print is dead.
In the physical sense.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
In a storage facility.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
See!  They are using drugs.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Who was the architect?
Well, that ought to do it.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
Send them out!
Do you want posters, too?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I'll nose around...
I've read of it.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
I can't let you do that.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Death is a very light thing for you.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Yes.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Yes.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Yes.
Well, I want you to leave.
What?
I don't feel well.
I don't know.
Oh no. He said that.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Yes I am.
Oh -- no sir.
No, sir.
Will you bring it in to me?
Where are you?
Where is your luggage?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
But it's light in there now.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
No.
Yes.
Sit down, Benjamin.
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Yes.
Benjamin?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
A drink? Of course.
Why don't you get it.
To tell you?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
INADEQUATE!
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
There!
We're talking.
How many times a year.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Art?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
I don't think we were the first.
Really. I want to know.
That's enough.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Did I say that?
You wouldn't.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Thank you.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I don't believe you.
Go home now.
No.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Have you thought about graduate school?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I'd like to hear it.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
Dad -- can you listen --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
I don't believe it.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
With the pearls?
Would you like to make a man happy?
You live here?
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
So alone.
Strange man...
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
I should like to smoke.
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
And what do you do -- now?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
All right then.
All of that at once, Baron?
Yes -- but the audience.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Don't do that. 
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Most imposters are --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Oh yes, of course.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
I understand you perfectly.
Definitely off.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Yes, I know them --
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good night.
Well -- gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
What's bluff?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
Roy? He's always crying.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What? He's going to be all right!
You know who I work for.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
But what's wrong?
It's not your fault.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Bluebell came in?
That's right.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
I pay my debts.
You do?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
Just a few bucks.
No.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
A future. The only future I've got.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Every day in every way.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
I'm a salesman.
Nobody does that single-o.
I've heard the name.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Well, when you put it that way.
Charming.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Nothing's missing?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
What?  Where is she?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Why not?
Can I come in?
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Okay... thank you.
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Can't you hold it?
You're so easy...
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
The voice man!  He's here!
Like what?
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
An old friend.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
No!!!
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Tell them yourself!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
So long, Colonel.
Let's talk about it some other time.
You ever own a motorcycle?
Let's talk about something else.
How do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Everybody says he was so brave.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Excellent!
It makes life spicy.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
"The sting."
"The sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Will you go to bed?
Damn.
Make it fast.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
I'm engaged.
This is crazy.
Not at all.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Please--
Which one?
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
And no one's there now?
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
He cried.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Honor, I suppose.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
She's crying because she's so happy.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Yes.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You hope.
What is this thing that kills me?
You didn't even find that out?
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
Premature ejaculation.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
No.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
Not true.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Don't worry about it.
He isn't any friend of Father.
No!
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
He'd assume we had.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
How nice.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I'm sorry.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
It is?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
I believe in miracles now.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Yes, we do.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
No, just not the type.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Yeah.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Yeah, yeah...
I don't know no Tod.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
What's that shade of blue called?
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Ulcers.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Of Joanne's?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
Is Kristen safe?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Why can't I meet him now?
You wife isn't dead is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
I can't tell you that.
But then you'll forget about me.
And better?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Where is she?
No.
But this is my apartment.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
I want to meet Ratan.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
No.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
I don't know.
What's that?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Was he with a girl?
No.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Check.
Not very.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Yes. Very much.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
But what?
Thank you.
What were you fighting for?
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Yes. They're old friends.
I don't know. Perhaps.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
I'm getting married.
No. My uncle.
No. Like this.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
No.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Huh?
Yes.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The Cenobites.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
What are you trying to say?
Each of us gets a belt.
I'm in charge. We go back!
Hostage negotiations.
How big can it be?
Goodnight.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Out? Out out?
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
Where's my father?
No!
It's important.
Who are you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
I said no.
This afternoon.
Oh my God.
It's just been empty a while.
No. I'm not.
I'll be scarred for life.
O.K.
Please...
Please.
That depends.
I suppose that's right.
We don't need a bed, do we?
O.K.
You like?
Me like.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Sure.
What?
I'm afraid it's true.
What's the problem?
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
It's not what I heard.
What happened to you?
Will you GO, damn you?
You gotta be kidding me.
Play it.
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Not the point.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
How do you know about that?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
We're getting that anyway.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
Why?
Where's Rob?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Is there a difference?
What do you mean, four more?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Hey Rob.
Huh?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
-- FUCK OFF!
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
It's Vince and Justin.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I suppose so.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I don't know.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
We'll talk some other time.
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I guess I am.
I can't talk right now.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
What it was like.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
I know.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Is Ray going?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Yes.  You?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Right.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
No, we...
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Claymore.
Happy birthday.
I don't follow you.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Grave robbers?
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
Dupont Circle.
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
No.
Go home.
No one knows you're here?
Follow me.
Yes.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
He is older than I.
That's insane.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
You killed those other two.
I haven't killed _you_.
Yes.
Now there's a new topic.
What do you want from me?
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
-Luceat ei-
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
You're a long way from Inverness.
It is the truth.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Do what you must.
Certainly not me.
So sure?
It never changes, Major.
Stay out of it.
Yes, he was.
Figure she's with him?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
He always did.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
Leave her out of this.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
I presume it's a sword.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Out some place.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.

Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Your luck's not with you now!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
What home?
You bet I've got a better offer.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Keep away --
I'm not working for any other paper!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Thanks...
Afraid? I should say not!
Better.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Never mind that. What's the story?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
How much do you want on it?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Sure, boss.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
Call you back.
Little rum in yours, too?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
With a bag of marshmallows.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
If there was any way out...
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
Shoot to kill, I said.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
My name is Louis Peluso.
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
I thought so, too.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
How'd you get here, Earl?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Shut up, you!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Come on, fellas.
I give that marriage six months.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Say them.
OK. You're in.
Would.
You do it. You're a girl.
It's easy. I've done it.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
I don't know?
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
I will if you will!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
What's that?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Just ignore her, Mac.
After this dance.
Who said anything about love?
Or what?
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Yikes.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Well, yeah, kind of.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You know... a couple of queers.
Hey, wait take this.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
OK, Boss.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Is that all... think real hard.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
That's nice.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
Yep, I suppose it is.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Where's Bill?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
What should I do?
Well, go get her.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Call Wydell.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I always favored the Hulk.
Right...  ...come on.
And?
Oui.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
That would be good.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
That's what I'm counting on.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Where?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Paper or cloth?
Nathan!
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Yes, darling.
A deer?
He looks perfectly fine.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I have to think! I have to think!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Of course not.
Really?
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Lila...
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Extra dessert?
here, here.
Yes.
Yep.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
You tell me.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Twelve thousand.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Two.
Yeah? Why?
I got drunk.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Where?
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
I said we're leavin'.
Fifty per cent?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go to hell.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Talk to me, Charlie.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Aw, Eddie.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Shoot.
Can I sit down?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Raw.
I've got something in my bag.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Give it back to me.
Me. It's Eddie.
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
First time for everything.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
No.
Yes.
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
You want to kill them.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yes.
Only got one kind.
Yes.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
What, Jim, what?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Where, Jimmy?
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Oh?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Connie, don't hang up.
I take it you've heard.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Did it work?
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
What're you talking about?
Three years.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I'm making a mess.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Then find them.
Roger.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
How long would their shields be down?
Oh. Sorry.
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Here... now.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
All your life.
Do you believe, Marcus?
Where?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Mine, too.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
I came to get you! What do you think?
Well, uh...
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
So did I.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What happens at eleven o'clock?
I know, Dad!
Dad, we're well out of range.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me -- my god, I've to get ready!
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend! I saw it! I'll show you!
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Just a statue.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
What evil?
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Siam.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Just one arm!
Just try and control yourself.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Quiet!
There's got to be another way out.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
What's going on?
It wasn't him.
Me.
Your name is Al...
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Where are we now?
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
I just went there for a job.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why not?
I'll tell you what to say.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Outrun them.
Then what are you stopping for?
Why?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I did. I brought you back here.
Black suits and helmets.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
What about it?
I can't do that.
Why not?
The beach?
You eat it.
The sand.
Why not?
Follow it.
Don't just stand there, say something.
...Rene...
Rene...
You get time off to sleep.
Follow her.
On what?
I can't see a thing.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
Well...?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Don't give her your name.
Let us get to the border!
It's a long story.
What a nerve!
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
That name's familiar.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Oh...that's okay.
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Take the card.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
I noticed you staring.
Yessir...very good sir.
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Like there's someone else here.
...and sort of...disinterest.
You're doing...Okay.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
There's not much to tell.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
How?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Why did you, then?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
We just don't stop.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Yes.
Where?
Sure. Where?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Oh, I love that stuff.
You're exaggerating!
You're taking "no" for an answer?
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Hey, Lowell.
What about you, you got a crew already?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
You're sure you want to do this?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
No, thank you.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Hello? Yeah...
Alright.
Yeah.
Alright?
No shit.
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Black, black...
If you want to do it.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Jeff...
I heard.
ABC...?
Hello, can you hear me now?
A delivery device for nicotine.
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
Object to the form!
When should we do this?
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
You did good, Massey!
Who do you want me to kill?
Sustained.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
No frown lines.  New watch?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
You have the pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So, that's good, right?
Yeah. I guess. You know --
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Huh?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I bet.
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's blackmail.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
I thought so.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
So. Now what?
Wow.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Mm.
Video.
No. You're not.
Berry spoons.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
And only two are hers.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Come in. Sit down.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, hello, Dad.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
Fine man to fall in love with.
I don't know.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh—the papers—
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
I can't go out like this.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
No. No. It's too good a story.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Well, take them off.
What's got into you?
Thought you were hungry!
But what!
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You! Don't make me laugh.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
A black eye. 
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
What about money?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Come here, you little fool!
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Whatever you say, darling.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Huh?
Don't "Joe" me.
Yeah, where am I?
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
And Oswald?
No, I'm not...
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Yeah.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
No, I did not.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
There were admirals.
Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Huh?
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
One shooter.  One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams.  I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people.  Hunters...  patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1...  green!"  Or else "Abort!  Abort!"
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Was he there often?
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
That's it.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Won't forget?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
In his inside coat pocket.
And you didn't tell the Police?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
What's she want?
What's she willing to give us?
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
I'm not saying another word.
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Can you do it or not?
Fine.
In cash.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Shit.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I am. Have a seat.
Black's fine.
'76?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He called you?
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
It's different with men.
Yeah.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Catching a movie.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
I see.
Has he hinted around?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
You do that?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Not after they're dead.
We're partners.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
I know what it looks like.
You know what we want.
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
And splittin' with her?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
That would be one point of view.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Talk to you tomorrow.
A woman.
Managers get ten percent.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Two months shy of four years.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
That sounds like a problem.
Are you sweating?
You sure?
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Guess where I am?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
That was Beaumont.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
What's your relationship?
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
You shot her twice?
Where's the rest of it?
How much it there?
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Watcha gonna see?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Yes.
It still sounds high.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Git your ass in here.
How'd you find me?
Winston found you.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
That I gotta see.
You sure?
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Where do you want to go?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
It's all been a dream.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No, thanks.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
I'm okay.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
It's cold.
Don't go.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
Why do you say that?
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
Wiggle your toes.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
I'm walking, aren't I?
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
What's your name?
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Your back? Did you fall?
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
They're like demons, Jez.
We're at Della's.
The numbers stop at 107.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Here. I'll do it.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
You can have anything you want.
Oh?  Where you going?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
What is wrong with you?
Push 'em back.
Help me!
We're doing everything we can.
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
Count 'em on one hand.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Oh God. I know. I know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
Speaking of which, duck!
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Thorgan? You coming?!
I don't know!
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
You got that right.
You just keep an eye out.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Negative.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
You'll be fine.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
He's right behind us!
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
I'm on my way.
Again?! Jesus!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
That ought'a help the situation.
A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
Sory...
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
No! He's coming with us!
Thirty seconds.
I gotta go back.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Are you finished?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
My boat's neat, dad!
What?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
I know who he is...
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Have you ever had one do this?
No!
He's taken him!
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Just sign it, Larry.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
We never had any. What's the problem?
Do I set the goddam hook?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
So would I. Come on in.
This is Quint, Missus.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Fasten the pole.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
I don't know...
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
Excuse me?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
I know enough.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Viscera?
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
You weren't even alive!
No, more commercial stuff.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
You're kidding!
Well, it can really only go two ways.
I know what junk is.
Hey, I like this.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Nope. We're safe.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
What's the matter?
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Nothing.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
You're pregnant?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Can you see it?
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
...Yeah.
So you don't do any of those things.
He whips you?
Adele... are you serious?
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Best kind.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Could be.
Where would we find him?
17.
Yeah.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
It's no big deal, right?
Right.
Yep.
Darcy?
Yeah.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Shut up.
Fifteen for me.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
Yeah.
What do I want to do?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Everything is wrong.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah?
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yeah.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
What?!
Hi Telly. Where you been?
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Yeah.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
Maybe you should.
The door was open.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
Did anyone stand out?
Where is she?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
Because she's the type.
Just like who?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
The police haven't told you?
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
Very good.  How did you know?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
He already did once.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
That has nothing to do with it.
Has he gotten through to any?
No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
You mean, no prints but hers?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
It's important.
I got it from the tournament directory.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
He knows you're aware of that.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Is it serious?
I can check and call you back.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
When I was very young.
No you didn't.
I don't think I could.
Of course.
Let's change the subject.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
And you?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Call room service.
For emphasis?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
But I do.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you're beautiful.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Colwyn ...
All directions are the same here.
That way. I can feel the cold.
The new Queen lives.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You have rope?
Reach out farther. Call to her.
It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
Yes.
He has come for Lyssa.
Yes.
I chose the wrong passage.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Yes. It is today.
Yes.
I ache with it.
You will not, then?
What else is left for a man without friends.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Not sleepy, either?
Naturally.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Look at its insides.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
A match for your son, I think.
A fine match.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
Yes. We lost five.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Her name is Death.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
But you would not stay with me.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
What?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Mathilda, stop, please!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Mathilda, listen!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh?
...No... he's my lover...
...And how much is it?
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
How serious is it?
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Thank you.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
That's enough.
You do?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
You're talking to me?
You like to take walks?
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
By car right?
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
California.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
No.
OK... whatever.
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Sera...
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
We?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
No... we already talked about that.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
Yuri... are you...
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
I loved him!
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
So everything you just said --
Yes, I am.
What'd you do?
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
That's terrible!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Yes, you are.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
So?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
Margot!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
And you know this for a fact?
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
So Friday at eight?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
What, like on va-kay?
Where's Warner?
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
So are you!
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
You go where?
Uh -- sure.
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
See?
Really?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Chuck.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Always.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Protection?
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Like some vile toadstool.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
What do you want from me?
I didn't know... I --
Cathay?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Who might these friends be?
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
To be sure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
And if I cannot?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Careful, lad.
Aye!  That too.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Beware.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Stealing his arms?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Willful creature, that one...
There must be some way to get it up there.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Patience, lad.
I've not heard a note out of you.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Sport, indeed.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
I have no wife.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
And I... love you...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
You'll visit again?
Only that?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Heading north still?
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
That very nice.
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
He was there and then he wasn't!
We can work.
It's so beautiful.
What color?
Red.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'll survive.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
I can't even take a shower here.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
What are you talking about?
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Oh, yes.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Not a shower.
I want you both to stay.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I don't know.
I'll be around to check up on you.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
When are you going to be back?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
What I'm not.
What would you be doing now?
I haven't been touched in years.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
He doesn't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
What did you do with your dog?
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I don't have a phone.
What have you been before today?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
Going on?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
That's the problem.
Please don't leave me.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Can we really help build a house?
In the bedroom.
Not for me, it ain't.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
No, tell me what's so funny.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Still got that ten dollars?
So you made a generous contribution.
You lost all our money in a card game?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
So?
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
Forget it.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
So?
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
They gave me life, mama.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Anybody else need anything read?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Please, get out of my mind!
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Is this a joke?
It's just such a slap in the face.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Yeah, you do...
You're already there...
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
How bad?
Son, just do your best.
Thanks.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
See ya, fellas.
I'll just go to Heaven.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
I don't need luck. I'm good.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
If you want to.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
"Octopus people?"
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Sometimes, sure.
What are you doing?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
A black guy?
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Where do you send them?
You're a beautiful pair.
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
We're ready.
Just the face.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Not in my time...
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
When do you go up?
You prefer women?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Not about that.
Why is it wrong to run?
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
It's different now. Help me.
I wish I knew what you think I know.
That's nice.
Uh-uh.
No. Not that either.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Of course.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Hello.
Do you want to see Doc?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
Are there any other humans?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
More... many more.
And all alive you say?
Too little.
Good... You up for a drive?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Pile in.
Sure, I'm okay.
What do you mean by that?
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
Are you positive he knows?
I don't know.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Alice?
Sure.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
The wife killer?
Out in back.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
What's the word on the street?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
I don't know yet.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
The first night... Not the last two.
That's why I married you.
Maybe.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
From the club. You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
All right.
Thanks, guys.
What?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
The heart, I guess.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
All right!
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
You will.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Uh-huh.
Not at all.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Yes!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
No kidding?
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Okay, Lovey.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Gold. You were going to—
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Oh, yes.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
When was all this?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Now, what would you like to do?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Thank you.
Pardon me—
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Oh, the girl at the piano?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Yes.
Right, Bob.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
What are you talking about?
Uh-huh.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
I'd go mad!
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What's she got to do with it?
In for what?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
Thank you.
Cowan--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I guess I lost:
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Actually, sir--
I'd go with number three.
Yup.  Sure is.
So what's the problem?
There's a god damn good reason.
What?
You think that's what's-happening?
The Pentagon.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
Actually, you may have.
What is it?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
They're not my pals--
Did it leave?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Someplace safe.
Then who was he?
I know... I do, too...
Why?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Can you fake the cerebral output?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
I show a cop on horseback.
Did he close the front door?
What?
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
So now I need you to hack into her.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Sean --
Once I even told him I loved him.
I was looking for you...
What the fuck is going on?
Good-bye, Crow.
You don't seem all that proud.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Not.  Now.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
What?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
There's thousands of units like this one.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I know who you are.
It was nobody's fault.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
No thank you.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
We have snifters
What's 'incidentals?'
Are you sure?
So?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
See you later.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Oh, please.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Ho's a good guy --
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
I don't get it.
She'll be out in a minute.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Yeah.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
They were out of line --
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
You want --
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Well, this is the corner.
It's important.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Can you check?
I'll page you with the number.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Pretty nice.
You sure?
How much was it?
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
I don't know.
So we're working?
About what?
C'mon, man...
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
Tom. How's it going?
The line's over there.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Excuse me.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Why? What I say bad?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
No, really, mate?
The Soho Grand?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Keys.
So, we're talking money laundering...
That's none of your fucking business.
And where might that be?
He had it coming.
Heard where?
What?
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Nnnnnnn!
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Who are you?
I don't know what to say to Allah.
I want to. God knows I want to.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
I can handle it.
You have enough worries of your own.
Just an idle question.
Are you?
Hush your mouth.
You're with me even when you're away.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
I'm not made of glass.
I just want to sit here and be still.
We need you too!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Betty it's me. It's me.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
I don't think we know for certain.
Just what are you saying?
What?
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Your control over your children, therefore --
Let me die then.
...That isn't a whore?
You better believe it.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
So what about him?
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
No.
What do you want?
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
So you are going to talk me to death.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Where does he live?
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[I want you.]
[Don't lie to me!]
Show me, please.
Have you used this type before?
I'm here.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
No.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
My ankle.
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
Did you used to?
I'm sorry.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Your father has business.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Dyslexic?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
You're American.
No.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Last night. Do you know something?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
This is Mr. Creasy.
[A beautiful circle.]
That's what friends do.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
It's early.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Yes, I know.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Please...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Goodnight.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Right.
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
You talked to Walt?
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
They give you copies to burn.
Which hospital?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Not enough to be a pro.
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Wisconsin.
You make a mean martini, kid.
And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
He can't take much more time on the table.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Call Dago Red.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Be right with you.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
What?
You betcher ass, General.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
C-A-M-E-M...?
I like an olive.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
All of them?
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
You're leaving tomorrow?
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You think he won't.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I can try, sir.
Damn.
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
Are you all right?
Against anything. Just protest.
You got me.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
How much money do you get?
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
What John Doe?
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Thank you.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Yeah, a little.
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Who?
Who are they?
All right. You're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Sure.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Why—uh—
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
Out the window! Something just flew by!
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
Good. I don't want to be late.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Is that where you're family lives?
You're gettin' the car.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Being faxed over now.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
Sorry... Habit.
Like it had to be done.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
Not the ones I'm at.
Do you really?
I think I can handle that one.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Get good at it.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
To save lives.
Fine.
Still needs work.
The jockey!
Is it always like this?
He's cutting down the visibility.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Only that floor.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
If you did, you never showed it.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Just now.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Scottie...
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
The hell I am!
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
What?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
The car is part of the deal.
I'll provide you with transportation.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
What do you need?
I need to take back what's mine.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
For what?
Sorry?!
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Activated.
Male.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
-- Standard.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
What's a Triac?
Release the power with the power.
Did I say anything?
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
Tell me about it.
Poor, yeah.
Why should I be?
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I was calling yesterday.
I needed to see you again.
I'm doin' business here!
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
How soon can we pull this off?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Who?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Never threaten me, Boss.
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Not if they all die at once.
Don, I'd be honored.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
I'll take care of the Boss.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
This is nice. I mean it.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Olive or eyeball?
Sad commentary, huh?
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Mm hmm.
This way?
Forty-five all total.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Huh?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Whadaya mean--*right*?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Yeah. What about the second act?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Tunnel?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Oh, a *boy*!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Uh--could--could I help--?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
For one week!
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
No, Jeff--please--!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Tonight.
What?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Thanks very much.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
No complaints.
Lena.
I've got more. You better tell me.
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
You--don't know it, do you?
Second drawer.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Hurray!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
No--I mean--yes--that is--
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
How's that, buddy?
Swell!
What! Who?
What do you mean? What's going on?
A Bill! Not *him*!
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Let's get away from here. 
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Susan!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Okay. See you here.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Well--me, too!
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Anything *better* to offer?
Senator Paine.
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Page boys!
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes, indeedy.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Really?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
It's wonderful.
That depends on what they see.
Why don't you try?
What did you mean by that?
Gosh! What do you know about that!
He did?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
With pay!
Have lunch.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Hello . . .
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Yes, but you said—
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Me sir?
Nuisance value?
Wants to know who the heir is.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
How do you do.
How do you do.
All right.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
That's funny. Why is that?
I'm Chairman.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
We own an opera house, don't we?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Oh. That.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Binge?
Christian Svenson.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Oh!
Yeah. What?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
Uh-huh.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Not any more.
I think he's got a point.
What's that?
What exactly is it supposed to do?
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Nope.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Tastes good.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
It was Henry Follett.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Lily.
He told you.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
I'm trying.
Got to.
Mother... go away!
What?
I think you do.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
What would you do?
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference!
Transference.
Which show was that?
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you wait for me?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
What are you talking about?
Uh-huh.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
Do you think that's what he wants?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
I've got three big ones.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
That's all right. What's on your mind?
It's just a thought.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Really?
What about everything? How did this happen?
It wasn't the best situation.
You and Candy...?
That'd be Lily.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
Yes, yes it does...
Yep.
Oh yes, of course.
Altar boys?
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
Intestines.
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
I would never!
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Because that's where I found it. I was there.
I just decked your brother
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Yes?
I think you found something.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Oh.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Of course.
Really?
I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Atta, boy!
Me, too.
Doctor Heller?
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Really?
Just a waitress.
Roy.
Who wouldn't?
Have you always lived here?
It's home.
What have they got that we ain't got?
What?
Bye. 
Monica!
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
SO WHAT?
I can't.
Who's chicken? 
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
Mother... it's not what you think!
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Through there!
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Ah-hh, no.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Does your mother know you have come?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Yes, it must be.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
And you, Junot?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Are you trying to insult me?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Were any of them prettier than I am?
She must have been in love with you.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
But you will not... be safe...
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
You wrote it.
God help me -- yes.
Yes.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
What I am talking about is moderation.
That is a matter of opinion.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
And I can go free?
Thanks, Unc.
Yeah.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I don't.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Me too.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Make sure.
Hold on.
I don't play for no team.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
It's alright.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
I don't have no damn cover.
You could sell your Beamer.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Call me.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
I don't know the number.
What?
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
I threw my back, again.
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
That's...a comfort to hear.
Ah.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
That's right.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
I'd like to know what...
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
I kill her - and you kill me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
To be a hero?
All right. Kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't know.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Fuck you!
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
Laughs.
I've got something for you.
Help me get her off the rug.
What about them?
Yeah.
What gives?
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Listen to me John.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
And I won't never tell about the money.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
No.
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Icey, I don't want a husband.
John don't like him much.
The money, Icey.
Satan.
Amen.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Blue men.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
No, that's just it. No.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
You could save him, little bird.
Mm-hm.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
All right.
Pearl and John.
She turned me out of the bed.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
I was praying.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
Answer me!
Where's she at?
What's wrong, John?
Now who was this?
Jesus.
Not really.
Used to. Not anymore.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
How you plan to do that?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
I won't.
Great
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
Of course. What's that?
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
And you too, Ninotchka.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
And there?
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Or it might be the firing squad!
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
Yes, Comrade?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Good morning, Gaston.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
If you want to see us you must come later.
Get out of here!
Monsieur.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Even the swallows are back.
What can I do about it?
Confess what?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Oh no. No visa.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
No.
Yes, very strange.
I will do my best.
Yes.
Is that customary?
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Wounded? How?
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
As a representative of Moscow...
Then do it through my lawyer!
On which boat?
No.
No.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Thursday.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Not white, darling.
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Oh, Leon!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Is this your new dress suit?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Unfortunately.
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Please... sit down.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Where do you eat?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
We could get that.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
How so?
You think this is just about politics?
I figured that out.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
No, sir.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
That's right ...
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's the parents' fault really.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.
We took his system out.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
She's quite pretty.
Agreed.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... Use his women.
You're shittin' me.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
POWs.  And their families.
Not that.  Us.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
You've been drinking.  What the hell are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like them now! ...  I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for the country.  These people running things, the elite ... they're soft, chickenshit faggots!  They don't have the long-term vision anymore.  They just want to cover their asses or meet girls or tear each other down.  Oh, God, this country's in deep trouble, Buddy ... and I have to see this through.  Mother would've wanted no less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.
Tomorrow.
No.
You.  What' you're doing --
Hiding what?
You're drunk!
They were for me.  They're mine.
There'll be time for that.
The "crises"?
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
You heard it?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Who's he in trouble with then?
The old boy shot by the highway?
Gun out and up.
That from the lock?
I don't know. He ought to...
No sir.
You gonna drive out there?
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Hyah!
That's very nice.
I can't plan your day.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
I put it in, Mama.
I ain't got the money.
No.
...I need to sit down.
What? Quit hollerin'.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Big talk.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What's that.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Well -- where ya goin'?
Yeah? Where am I?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
They'll give you a wallop.
Uh-huh.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Well enough.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
I know how he found me.
Took me about three hours.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
It wasn't a woman.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
Any idea where it is?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Do you know why I'm here?
...to see you.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
"Thirty-two?"
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
You never gave us a chance...
Didn't I?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No, almost never.
Rosa...
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
Good.
Really. And where was that, old man?
If we're for real?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
A mark, huh?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
I know that.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
He's waiting...
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
David Ravell.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Mr. Campbell?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Good Lord, what do we do?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Oh my God!
Oh, okay.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
That ain't it!
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Latch right on to that tit.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's right, honey.
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
Buyin' nipples!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
I joined the Navy.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
I'm doing okay, sir.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
I called you Sarge.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
He was. He died.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
I got my foot on the floor.
No way... Would you?
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Not me.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
There's always a choice.
You're better than candy.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I've never had a girl.
It sure was.
What's stopping you?
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
No, they're for your mom.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I know that.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Naw.
This is ridiculous...
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
This was your department, Junior.
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Where did you get this clown?
Hey.
And we're never getting in.
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
It's just the woman and the kid?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
The hell we are.
0150.
I heard you.
Nope.
Come on, come on...
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
I'm sorry.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Yeah.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
No sir he didn't.
So talk...
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
No man. Gonna walk.
Right on Brother Judge...
What, I don't know how you mean?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Well, act like it. Come on.
Just a kid.
Shut the fuck up!!
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
You don't look alright.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
It's a start.
That would be nice.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I said, I'm not my sister.
Of course, I do.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Lovely.
Colonel will do.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Sir.
Perhaps.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
Yes.
Is that so?
Pride is his weakness.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
She is.  Don't go in there.
That's right.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
Harry, Harry, Harry...
That's a damn long time...
You said bribery twice...
And your principles?
Gabriel.
Thank you.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Goodbye, Harry.
When?
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
Yes.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Good for you.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
And because the dead walked.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
I'll torture it out of you.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
You can go to your grave not knowing.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Commodore, you can't do that!
It would appear, so do you.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
More to drink!
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
We're not going to just surrender!
This must be some important boat.
You would do that?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Where does it make berth?
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Jack!
Yes, I have.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Still --
No.  She hasn't.
Please.
Speak.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
You're not rotting meat.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
What I asked you earlier?
The nanobot is gone.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
Yeah, I do!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
Well, you got another problem.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Been out for six months now.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
I guess I should be flattered.
Yeah, we'll see.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Blame the victim.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
That's going to fit me?
Like a glove.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
Argon's private lab.
I have to!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Oh yeah?
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes - Sing Sing.
Goodbye, Stew—
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
O-o-oh, I get you—  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Yeah?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Not on my own beat, no.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Is that so?
That's so.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
Oh no, sir!
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Hello, Stew.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
What could I be?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Thanks. May I sit down?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
Why—
Have you seen this? 
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
I just putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yes.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
Sure.
Bud brought it to me.
Bud?
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
No I'm not.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Oh yeah.
She won't go out with me?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
No. What?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Well, I never had to do it before.
YOU get lost!
Just take deep breaths.
To who?
What do you mean?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Nothing.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
That's right.
What?
Why?
I understand.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
So they can have their hamburgers!
Well here I am.
Hey.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Ok, bye-bye.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
That's your fault not mine.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Yes.
Really?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
Not very late.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
This is not cool.
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
Ok.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Yes no not really.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
...what...?
This is nice.
That's right you travel so much.
Let's go to the hospital.
Did you do it?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Thank you.
It's alright.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
You have an ATM?
Yes.
Are you serious with this?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Seriously.
Yes, yes, right.
As soon as you want.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Ok.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Why not?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
That's enough.
His rug.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
No. It most certainly was not.
Enough!
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher mission.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Is it awfully violent?
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What thought is that?
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Yeah
Bel Air is restricted.
I just want to understand--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
How so?
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That's right
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
But with compassion and insight--
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Oh Christ...
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
And what does he see?
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Craig is one syllable
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Uh huh.
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
This ain't George's doing--!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Again
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Ok, champ.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Believe what you want.
It's not done.
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
Jack! Enough!
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
You wasn't with her, were you?
With her? How?
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
You want the title shot?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
It feels real good.
Just give it a nice little tap.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Who asked you?
I'm not interested in him.
You're not interested in him?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I am answering...
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Are you drunk?
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Never felt better.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Excuse me for living.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Goodnight.
Namely?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I'll bet it's been done.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
All right -- you don't believe me.
Six ayem.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Give him evidence.
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Mrs. Thorwald.
Your logic is backward.
That depends on who "they" were.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
For what?
For getting rid of that cast.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Gunnison?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Stella!
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
In this heat?  They're up now.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
There's something buried there.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Make the one you want.
How can you tell that -- from here?
I think it's enchanting.
Of course not.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Something too frightful to utter.
What is it you're looking for?
What are you getting at?
What about it?
What doesn't?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
I do?
The same.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Chicken?
How'd he get in?
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Yes.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Say, listen--
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
He's home.  I heard the car.
Well maybe she better start.
Plato.
I'll wait for him.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
Jim.  What's yours?
He has a knife.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Who has?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Get away from me!
I'm here.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
My gun?
They like you.  Okay?
And you wanted him to make a list!
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Yes, ma'am.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Oh.
I'm not so bad.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
You were looking for me, weren't you?
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
No!  I got to find him.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
What?
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
YES!!!
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
No, c'mon --
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Your brother...
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
What the fuck is going on.
Nick, what are you --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
You told him about Nick's letters.
No --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Yes!
Wish I had a brother like you.
I don't know.
Christmas... Eve...
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
And I worked there. For a year.
Might as well be.
Put it on.
Don't tip.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
I'm no threat without a gun.
Leave the tree.
I don't know... what you're...
What... Powwow...
OPEN IT!!!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN! THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Thought you hate your old man.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Ash... Ashley...
...be with her...
But... I had a five...
What?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
I don't know, but somebody did.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
How can you tell?
Yeah.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Why am I Mr. Pink?
You gonna put it away?
Who gives a damn?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
That's your proof?
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Nice Guy Eddie.
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
As opposed to good?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
That was the plan, we meet here.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
But you eat, don't you?
We can't stay here!
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
You should know. She's in your dream.
I'll make the soap myself.
But the rest is right.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Maybe they will.
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
In a fight?
Yes.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Finished, son?
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I just wondered. Let's go.
You'll live.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I said I didn't care.
But I want to stay.
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Yes, people make me restless.
Even women?
And you're all alone.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
What for?
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
No. We're not stayin' --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
How about California?
And you've got me all figured out?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Do I know you?
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
No, stay.
Alright!
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
No. Keep rubbing.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
I'll go.
You could use the grade, huh?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
I wouldn't go that far.
Who?
Don't touch me!!
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
No, I'm fine.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
You scared me.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Ooohhhh!
Yes, I did.
I certainly did.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
I beg your pardon?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Certainly not!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
I'll give you fifty cents.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
No.
She could use a hundred dollars.
What is it?
I did her hair.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
A job?
The people at the restaurant?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Yes.
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I have something even better.
Devil worshippers!
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Uh—huh.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Yes. When I tell you.
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
You know where she is?
It seems right to us.
No, she's with her sister,
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
I'll be out in a minute.
She's very beautiful.
When?
But he also wrote --
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
Thank you.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Basically, yes.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Not really.
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I know.
What difference does it make why I do it?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I have money.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Absolutely not.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
I guess not.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
About me?
Can't or won't?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
God, I m so mad at him!!
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I'm not planning on it.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
I don't know.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
No.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Always the lawyer.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Not very often.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Yeah, so?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
I say it because it's descriptive.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
And what?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Then why'd you call me?
What kinds of questions?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You are in serious trouble.
I don't want to discuss it.
Well. I can't stay.
Okay.
Bye.
Doing what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Your first sexual experience.
Very much live.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Do you like the way I look?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
No, I mean doing it at my house.
You're intrigued?
I want to see you.
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Nothing wrong with trying.
I don't think my sister would agree.
Hung up.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
How about straightening up the living room?
A bonfire, probably.
Really. How'd it go?
God, you need help.
No.
Yes?
All right, jesus.
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
No, nothing.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
Do I get a kiss?
Uh, OK. Sure.
No. Dotty's the last.
OK. But late.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Nick, you're so strange...
Just breathe normally.
That's the one.
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Home?
Why Janet?
So it seems.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
He was a President.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
Absolutely correct.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
You got it.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
That's what people say.
No, I'm an actor.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Anything I'd know?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Yeah, Conundrum.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
And get your bone smooched.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Now we're talking.
What color is it supposed to be?
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Then it's a good thing.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
We were supposed to play golf.
Count me out.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
What the fuck are you doing?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Obsessively.
It's private.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Are they too sporty?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Uh-huh.
No way. No way.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
No, I'm okay.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Twelve months in oak.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Um... yeah but it's more...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Goodnight, Miles.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
French or American?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
This one?
A hair.
No dad!
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
I heard them Morgan.
Me too.
...I will.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Curse and stuff.
No I'm not.
Yes, it was.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Yes.
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
We have to go in the basement.
From what?
It needs batteries.
It's old Morgan.
Don't do it.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Where are we going to sleep?
What's that?
There are none.
No.
Yeah.
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
What friend is that?
McKendrick.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Paden sends his best.
Yeah... that must have been it.
You're not Baxter?
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
No, Leavenworth.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
It's a town...
I expect.
It's not going to be easy.
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
You haven't got any money.
All right, you buy me a drink.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Howdy.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What about his brother?
Luck, I guess.
I run the place. What can I get you?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
That was my plan.
I wouldn't worry about that.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
The picture's dead.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Why isn't she with you?
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Even the fall from the plane.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Soon.  Soon.
You?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Well, I --
Do what you do to Simone.
And what may I ask brought this on?
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
You want me to call Security?
Not like this --
-- Flesh is weak.
Hello, Lainey.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
I do.
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
No, that was me.
It's a yacht.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Dark?
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
We used to.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Dr. Crowe.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
I forgot myself.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
I told you what I want.
I don't know, Cole.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
You believe now?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Witch.
I happen to be a professional.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Sorry.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Harvest moonshining!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Sure. What do you want to know.
People say he was a murderer.
Yes!
So?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Never.
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
Us? We been... moonlighting.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Just checking out the lights.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
Starla, it ain't --
That wasn't a good night, no.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
And this is mine.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shelby --
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Do it.
Brought you munchies.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
How many you need?
That's disrespectful.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Driving, talking to me...
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
We lost him.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
You could've asked.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit I, come back.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Yeah, guy?
What's your twenty?
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You okay?
I'm cucumber cool.
Yeah, but...
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
You have a butler working that floor?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
You're sure?
Mmm-hmm.
Two of 'em?
Yeah, why.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
Wow.
Yeah, I can front this.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Shoot.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
That takes some of the sting out.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
What do you want?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You'll end up like me.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Why would you let her to do that?
How quickly?
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
He's dead.
What?
Probably.
No.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Yes.
I love her.
Yes.
Book?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I love you.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
I wish you wouldn't.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
What do you want?
Stop being nuts!
I don't know.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Yeah.
"To"... Forget about you.
I think it's probably still a good idea.
Claire...
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
I'd identify him.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Did you hear what I said?!!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I watched TV.
No.
I just sat and listened.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Let my kid go.
I know where everything is.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Or was it all a dream?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
Don't be pitiful.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
You're making my life difficult.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Even if they're not clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Some prep school thing.
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
Hi, Adele.
I... I like you.  A lot.
So you've found Thorkel?
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
Peter-- my condolences.
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I'll introduce you.
Use a fork.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
Your dog ate it.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
How much do you know about it?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
No, no!  Not there!
We did not.
Jawohl.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
What some brandy?
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Say, Schulz --
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
So what? There's other women!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
You did?
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Good.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
A little weak today.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Okay, Price. You stay.
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Shoot!
Just what makes you so popular?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Give me the radio.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
That is my wife.
HoS qorDu. 
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
I was attempting to get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous.
Why would you want to leave?
I don't understand.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
Phasing? To where?
I always do.
What's normal?
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Thank you, Number One.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
On screen.
In code to STARFLEET... Captain's Spock's tube located intact on Genesis surface. Will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Not exactly.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Why would you do this...?
The ship... Out of danger...?
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Indisposed, sir.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
But, why?
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
But -- why?
... Yes...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Success, my lord.
Yes, my lord!
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Sir, may I --
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
From yourself, Admiral.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
... Can't read you... repeat...
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
How soon --
Only half of you would get there.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Inoperative.
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Perhaps I no longer need to try.
KHAN!
Admiral? He didn't tell you how <u>Admiral</u> Kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
Aye, sir.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Admiral, this is Spock.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Home.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Aye sir --
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
... No, sir. It has not.
Energize defense fields.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
They just don't want us going in there.
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Trying, sir!
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
No power to the weapons system, sir.
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
Yeah.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
We've done it before.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
I buy that. What about him?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Go ahead.
What do you mean now?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
A spaceship with a missing man.
Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.
You need me.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
In progress, Admiral.
What is our target in time?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
What are the variables...?
You've programmed that from memory...?
Well done, Mr. Spock.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
On speakers.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
That's the ticket, laddie.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
But not you.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
You're what?
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
No one's ever asked me that before.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Are they in any danger?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
It is over.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Understood.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Scan for lifesigns.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
I don't believe it happened that way.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
You got me, Commander.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Aye, sir.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
Say the greeting again...
Wine, women and song.
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
Was I doing something to your neck?
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I... do not want this...
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
I believe so.
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
Let's go.
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Always am.
Entering the upper ionospere...
I'm on it...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Yes.
Invasion.
Yes, he is.
What makes you say that?
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
No... I'm from France.
Aye, sir.
Fire.
Aye, sir.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Right.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Come on...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Now there's a poser.
Then let me help!
Barely.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
The drink WAS served...
Yes.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Your honors, the State rests.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We must do this again soon.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
Perhaps you're right.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
An error.
You can't prove any of this...
Confirmed, Captain!
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
Nevertheless.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
Yes, sir.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
You are me.
No.
Indefinitely.
You're working late.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Yes, sir.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Why?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Do you have a moment, sir?
No!
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
What programs were accessed?
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Aye, sir.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Won’t do what, Mister Worf?
On screen.
Who was it?
Aye, sir.
Your new chair, sir.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes.
You know I do.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
No race should be a slave to another.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
New worlds.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I know.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Long ago.
He is what his life has made him!
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Should I raise shields?
We're being hailed.
What?!
You heard me.
She is here.
I'll take that.
Elmo's...
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Clarify that.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
You're not hearing me.
Watch it. They're coming out.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Gear shift.
Police...
Good.
Pancakes.
Smile... good?
I know.
I am husband?
Shit... shit... what shit?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Music.
It was yellow.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
But I speak English.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Go?
Goodbye.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
It's bad.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
That was beautiful.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I will go. But not you.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
Horses.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to gamble.
The cook again?
You could have killed us both!!
Sure.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Wait'll you see it.
No, sir. Radar.
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
You saw that?
Leave him alone, Tran.
Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
Jesus.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
What a nightmare.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Step into my office.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
But this is a bad one.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I intend to.
Jesus!
You bet.  Did you like it?
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
She never gave me a tape.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Yeah, but that was for love.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Jesus, Lenny.
Rams... that's football, right?
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
Why?
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
See you downtown.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
What's the bad news?
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You must travel a lot, huh?
You know, you ever think about other women?
What about his killer?
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
What are you doing?
This better be important.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
I was looking for a pattern.
I didn't use Low's name.
There was talk of a file photo.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here, he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out, righto? Agent Kulok, when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers, some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick, find a pliant sociopath, preferably a dead one, attribute to him unsolved cases, clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
Five months. I love it.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't be too harsh.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
Just routine stuff.
We did find these, however.
That's true.
What's up?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
You were right. He found me.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Who told you about her?
It was the mall.
You? You went by the book?
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Shuddup.
I'm sorry?
...maybe...
Thank you, Nikki.
Hi.
I'm Mike.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Just like that?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Mike...
...you might get cut out.
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
...then ask where you met her...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Did you get it?
Why not?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
Hi, Mike?
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
...Six months.
Fine... I guess. You?
You know, us.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
No problem.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
Well, that's dumb.
What's dumb about it?
They turned you down?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Sure.
You asshole.
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Whu?
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
That's not cool.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
That's bullshit.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, we're money.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Christy was nice...
Michelle went for you, right.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
What?
We're not messing with you...
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
...it's on.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
America has been good to me...
Godfather.
Shut up.
Understood.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
You understand him better than anyone.
For bravery.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
I know.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
We're all tired...
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
Michael...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael.
I'm thinking about it.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I'm busy.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I do wish to be baptized.
You think I scam?
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Sure. Any time.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Shut up!
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
It's vile.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
Sure. I love Venice.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
And Rome.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
No!
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Marge-maintenance.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
My fiancée.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Get on. I'll take you to him.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
And you, sir? Any better?
Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
It's all true.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Right.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I know.
Beating you away.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Thanks.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
It's okay.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Peter, I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Even your fiancée...?
Even her.
Does he stay with you here?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Where do you live?
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
What did you do?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
That's really something.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
Just follow me.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
That's fine.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
What's your real name?
I don't like my real name.
That's a nice name.
I don't remember.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What's so important?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here.  Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
Yes I am.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
I know. I tried that.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
Physical? Criminal?
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Iris?
Slow.
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Thanks.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
What, vou?
You knew?  All this time?
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
I am, too.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
That always used to work.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
I do?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
No kidding.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
I do.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Listen to me!  The young man in there...
Well, son, you're home!
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
But what?
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Ah.
Why?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Did you... did you...
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
Thanks.
She's very pretty.
Wish I could say the same thing.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
I... I don't believe this.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Actually, it's none of my business.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
I think so.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
When was this?
I don't understand.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Darling, of course I do!
What's the matter with them?
Yes?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Yes.
Yes?
Shall I call the doctor?
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
I told you. We met yesterday.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
Maybe we ought to leave.
We won't be here.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
I said I wonder if you could help me.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Ahhh, but I know you.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What made it...
Criminal.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
Only violators and practical jokers.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Oh, no you don't!
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
I'm sure.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Why?
But not for me.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
No, I have my things in the car.
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
What do you mean?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
No, no...
Melanie...
The bay doesn't.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
What do you suppose it is?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
How?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That would hardly be possible.
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Can't you please finish your drink?
But can't you give me any idea?
Aye.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
You've no thought of going there?
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
I can't.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
I have other means of sustenance.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Yes.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
Any attacks of pain since?
Yes, Doctor.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
I'm looking for my friends.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Keep that thing away from me.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
I know her friends.
So you're going to kill him?
It's what Lauren would do.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Could say that.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
I mean Lauren.
Not tonight. Honest.
What did I say?
Watch out!
Are you ok?
It's not what you think.
Please. Come inside.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Tell me what?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No foolin'? Will you?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Goodnight.
About 250 million of your miles.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
Well, we could--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
I was.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
But I suppose you know the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
What's Plan B?
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
Honda 250, huh?
Why?  They're only noodles.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
For a ride.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Did we have a date tonight?
You better not like him too much.
For what.
No.  I'm up.
Can we get a T.V.?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Take laddie.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Piss off.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Cool it, Palmer!!
Hell no.
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Probably the next meal.
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
You been made, MacReady.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
I think so.
Well, get to it.
A serum test possibly.
After all this mess.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Little over two hours.
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
Can you think of any other tests?
Bet the last place you ever go.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
When do you think it got to him?
What?!
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Yes.
The air... the power.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
We make them see what we wish.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
It can't all be like this...
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
A man can change his history.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I've seen it.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
I don't understand.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Why would you do that?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
And this is your "work"?
I can see Kalen's point.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
How do you decide?
You liked it there.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You know this?
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Mara --
Do you have it?!
Tell him to go away --
Exactly correct, sir.
Sir --
Why?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
My father has gone to a better place.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
You know that's not true.
Then it's time to change that --
I am.  Are you a climber?
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
You sure you know where to find one?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
What?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I know.
I don't know.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
It's Sunday.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
No, he didn't.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
Then, where are you going?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] We will.
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Good.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
The Jacket.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
You remember it?
Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Yes, baby?
What?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Aw, God.
You know what?  You're starting to irritate me.
You girls are in some hot water.
Yes, sir.  I know.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Oh, great.
Right.  Where are they?
My Lord.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What's wrong?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
What the fuck is going on?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Why now, Jimmy?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
How come he let you go?
Get the car.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
I won't wait up.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Yeah.
No physical evidence.  We can't prove he did it.  We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
What little dogs?
Well, you got it now.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
Shoot the radio!
Yeah, you want it?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Pass him!
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Oh.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
Way up ahead!
All this for us?
Say you're sorry.
Fuck that.
Yeah... sure did.
I'll try to be more careful.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Uh-huh.
Mints?
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
No I can't.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Ahh.
Pat Healy.
No, I mean
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
You're a movie buff?
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
I guess.
Come on, what were you going to say?
Huh... that's strange.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
What?
Same here.
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
What?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
'That right? Good for you.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Ah, she's okay.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Just a minute.
He's dead.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Hi, Ted.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Yeah?
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
What?! No please, sir --
So what's up?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
What's gotten into you?
Something your father would've come up with.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Dean Rusk!
What about you? Where are you going?
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Jesus Christ...
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
James Looks Twice?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Who the fuck is he?
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
Alright. Alright.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
When did we get that?
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Ray --
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Nothin'. Forget it.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
Some Indian time?
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Go ahead, Ray.
Good.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
How the hell do you know?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
You saw a MiG 21?
Where were you?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I was inverted.
You let me make a fool of myself.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
How about what?
I'm starting to sense that now.
You don't have to kill it.
About as much as they think about killing me.
You want to go ballistic?
I'm fine.
You don't have to do this.
It does.
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
Yes sir!
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
I'm not losing it again!
Any more MiGs?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Tom Kazansky.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Right.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I can't eject.
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's because you don't have any women.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
Figured out what?
Just below ten thousand.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Then why are you here?
You think I should quit?!
I never heard that.
What happened to them?
I'd advise you to hurry.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I know that.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Relax, you'll live longer.
Melina!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
The door opened.  You got it.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
I'm not your wife.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I'm here at Rekall.
Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
As real as any memory in your head.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
I saw them.
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
Enough for everybody to breathe?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Cannon fuse.
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Adios, bridge!
I'll go with that plan.
Oh shit!
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
I'm gonna help you.
We got a plan!
Only if something happens to me.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Around here?  Why would they?
Why do you all keep asking me?
It most certainly is.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Sustained.
Shut your sewer mouth!
What about entrapment?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
No. No...
Of course.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
We're taking the other case.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
-- What?
...What do you mean?
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
You're doing a murder case?
I lied.
Screw you too, Kitty.
Figures.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
No. You tell me, Shu.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
This and that.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- What trial?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
Get lost Bobby.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
What?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Someone else has it now.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Say no more.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Thanks.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Dancing.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I can't help you there.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
What'll it be?
You got it.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
James...
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Sex?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
School?
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
I'm fine.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes. It would be.
Yes.
I... yes.
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
Neurology?
How is that?
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Huh!
Nothing further, your Honor.
We went to Code Blue...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
Well, we...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Well...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I'm sorry...?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
That happens.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Overruled...
Exception!
Yes. It was, actually.
I think I will.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
That's what I am.
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
Who told you that?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...You saw her?
He's not in, Sir.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I'm going to get laid.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
I don't know.
I just saw her.
Yes, the roving nurse...
What happened in those three...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Let's go.
The same thing that happened on our Pacific Coast.  Anything from them yet?
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
It might give us something.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
Right.
Looks like the fishing was good.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Welcome to California!
Can I read it?
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Chase...
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
When do you think it'll be done?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
Really?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Captured?  How?
Then what is he doing?
That was Nancy, not me!
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Black's fine.
Not yet.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Fifteen.
Thank you.
Yeah.
What?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Because it looks good.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Passport?
I just brought you something to eat.
Do what?
It works?
I can't make it out?
Of what?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
I figured it out.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
What?
Yes, I was.
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
But I am also with the government.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
In many capacities.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
In a fire, as I recall.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
No, he picked me up.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
And you never told nobody about it?
Here she goes again...
She got me an abortion...
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
What's that, honey?
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Who knows, baby?
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
SAILOR!!!
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Fan works.
Yeah?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Love you, too.
What?
Shake hands with your daddy.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Wouldn't make any difference.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Where? In the leg?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Santos... I can't...
Put your shoulders back.
Whattya mean?
Your wife.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
She's a transvestite.
She's still a transvestite.
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Shut up and drink.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Hit your brakes.
Just go around him.
What's to tell?
So sensitive.
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
No. But I don't think that matters.
Excuse me?
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Who's got a gun?
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
You're right.
That's really it.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Sure.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Well done, James.
Who?
Colon cancer.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
The hell I am.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
She's left before...
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Grady.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I know.
It didn't come up.
Lucky guess.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Oh... yeah.
Only when I'm working.
And?
Give me a break, Grady.
That's weird.
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
I haven't heard of half of those.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Ah, come on.
Early July.
I'm just talking, man.
I know. I'm just saying I understand.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Sure.
Why not?
I bet you can.
Were you watching me?
Not yet.
Robin.
Got something to hide?
You can't talk to me like --
The one with the ax?
Little Red Riding Hood.
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Apartment's okay.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
How do you know?
Robin, listen to me.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
What?
Why not?
You think reflection is good.
Honest? No.
I don't feel anything.
I mean, when will I be normal.
I'm afraid not.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
You mean my problem?
To relax.
I'm relaxed.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I meant later... when you two took naps.
Time.
I'm all right.
Yeah, you.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
They're all assholes.
What?
Do you?
I suffer from insomnia.
Yeah.
It's not what you think.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
You must hate your brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Are you serious?
I'm not scared.
Neither am I.
Who doesn't?
What's your fucking problem?
I need a shower.
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
It's trying to communicate.
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
You noticed.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Why bring it here?
Got it. Over.
All right.  Do it!
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Check this out.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
But you just said that a month was too...
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
This one is gorgeous.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
As you wish.
At what?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
It takes even less.
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
I'm too sleepy.
What do you mean by sensible?
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
What do you think?
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What is it?
And where do you find the models?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
What other boat?
And what did they say about me?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
I don't see why I should mind.
I'll go and get my valise.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Agnes...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
It made them holy.
It's not my time of month.
I don't know... I don't know...
Yes.
Who?
I love you.
I don't know.
Where?
I went to my room.
I got sicker.
Do you believe she really saw them?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Because I don't want one.
Everything... I don't have children.
I'm not sick.
She can't hurt you any more.
... makes me...
Yes?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
And then...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
You're a mistake.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Of telling you.
Because I was afraid.
We went to chapel for vespers.
So I could go to him.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Yes.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
Look into the convent records.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
What business is it of yours..?
Yes... I...
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
How did she hide it during the day?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
What's his name?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Answers.
Earthquakes?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
I knew that after the fact.
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, God.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Pipe!
Do you think they ever existed?
Do you want to become one?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
No!
Before or after you killed the child?
The cards... you're bank.
Shurrup!
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Yeah?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I'll have a bash.
Grotty?
I don't care.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Sorry.
He comes from a large family.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Thank you.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Is she?
And what do you do about it?
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Is there a fire, then?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
What little old man?
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Don't be callous.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
No, I'm not.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Don't start. Look.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
Don't you remember?
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Hard to say.
The engines are fixed.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
No, I don't want us separated.
And be right back.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
Ask him.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
How do we locate the creature?
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
We're not going anywhere.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
We can use the flamethrower.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
Sun will be down in a minute.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Yes, thank heaven.
Maybe we could write it together.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Let's hear it.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Good!  Moisture content?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
Right now let's keep it closed.
Nothing.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Sure.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
I told you we... what's that?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
What?
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Yeah, I...
How?
Which mean physically going outside.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Don't wait for me!
What can I do?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
Tactical nukes, maybe?
What time's sundown?
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
That's right.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
It wasn't meant to be.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
She doesn't know.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
You next move, it seems to me, should be toward television.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Didn't you know?
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
That's nice.
Where's my coat?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Call me when you get in...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Many happy returns of the day...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
I mix what I like.
Paranoiac!
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
I've been aware of that for some time.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
A cowboy.
Why.
Why what?
Why you have to go out there.
So few come back...
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Everything.
You hear all kinds of things.
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Buy some.
The same size?
Miss Coonan...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
You don't like Eve, do you?
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
You probably won't believe me.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He's the best.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Oh, no...
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
They certainly don't waste much time.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
Oh, but there is-
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
I've got it.
Right here.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
She's just outside the door.
Well...
In a minute...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Eve.
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That was a pity...
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Nothing...
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Up in the room.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
You'd have been proud of her.
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
When's the audition?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
I promise.
--read 'em both and you'll see--
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
And you haven't called him?--
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
Who?
Maybe we are...
Goddamnit!--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Tell that to Muskie.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
We've just been talking to Young--
--Deep Throat?--
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
Something maybe big.
Go on.
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
So?
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
How grand?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I couldn't say.
I really want to know.
You can't believe that.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
No, it was good.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
No idea.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You can't sing at the competition.
You're missing the game for us?!
What?  We both have cars.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Sure.
You got it, stud.
You can crash at Stifler's?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Went home to shit.
He's going in!
Holy shit!
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Dad!!
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
I told you.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
So do I, Kev.
Okay.
Move with the music.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You got in.
Okay, don't stop.
I think "shithead" really says it.
How?
Just a second!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Okay.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
What?!  How do I do that?
That's the spirit.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Yep.
No way.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Just like sex with my wife.
Also like sex with my wife.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Serafine...?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Really.
Andy...
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
Looks like he lied to you too.
What about me?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
I told him it wasn't ready...
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!

It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Don't be
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?

Ah! Let us begin!
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
What's your name?
You don't want my autograph.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
M'm.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
You-you play... very well.
Okay, that's good.
Your grammy!
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
No, I got time.
Okay.
M'hm...
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Gimme a kiss.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
H'm?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
big subject with me, yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
I know you've only known me a short while.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Yeah.
Sinatra?
Will it change your wife?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
I don't know.
Yeah.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
That's sick!
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
What'd I do?
I did.
Commentary.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Hey.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
How about a ginger ale?
What difference does that make?
So the colored have enough trouble.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Yes, I do.
No.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
I don't know. I don't know.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
I'm not that good.
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Count on it.
Just did.  Jealous?
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Nice to meet you.
Forget it, Judy.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Probably not.
I adore him.
Whatever you say.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Not.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
Truce?
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
He'll find his way back.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
I don't look my age, Joe.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I'll never forgive you.
I'll be with you.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Me too.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Ah.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
I'm a little nervous, so...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
A lot of cakes.
You must have been a baby.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
Yes.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Yeah.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
It could be worse.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
I don't want to talk about it.
Thanks.
I hope they're watercolors!
Nevermind.
So where should I put it?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
<u>What</u>?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Divinely?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Yes?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Of course not --
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
Why are we so successful?
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
I can't think of any.
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Sure.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
Miss. 
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
Pick a card.
A cemetery?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Gin.
I just want some fresh air.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
I guess so.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Where?
Here.
In the knee?
I mean, after that?
Oh.
I guess so.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
The Vice Squad?
Sir?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Oh?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
I have a vague idea.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
No.
No kidding.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
The party's over.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Get more coffee.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Will you excuse me?
I don't believe you.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Stop that, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Don't you ever stop talking?
It won't happen again.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
My men --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Let's talk about you.
Who are you ?
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
God knows.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Shot himself. What for ?
Who knows what's up there?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
When'd you do it?
Looks pretty shallow.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Touchy.
What is it?
They must have seen the fire.
Yeah.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
Six to eight feet.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
I'm Kurtz.
Yeah, I like it...
How's yours?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
What is this bridge?
Cognac?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Anyone got a card?
107  CONTINUED:
139  CONTINUED:
I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.
Keep back.
She's dead.
I don't want to talk any more.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
Why?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
You don't feel cold?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
You don't know how true that is.
Shut up!

You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Stay out of it.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
We were just talking about him.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Uh-huh.
Spencer.
Okay.
Oh, please...
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Okay.
The stiff one eye?
I can't. I work.
My son.
Are you still coming?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Welcome.
No.
And?
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Here's the trouble with never.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
To hell with sex.
Yeah... Well...
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Were you asleep?
You know what? I...
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
How to die, mostly.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
All right, cut me a break.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
He's a pain in the ass.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Wait here.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Ask him.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
I'm coming.
Absolutely not.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
Probably.
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Okay, don't.
We go around once.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
What?
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
You're too late.
Do you want Rath or not?
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
The contract?
Paid in full.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Yeah.
You didn't know anything about me.
Until a minute ago.
He wants to kill you?
We don't have a choice.
Why didn't you finish this game?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Where you wanted to be?
How old were you?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
You were there?
What?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What happens if you do?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Sorry.
Check.
But he won't shoot you right then?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Except --
What happened?
What?
Jesus, if someone had --
No?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Yes.
Who was she?
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
Okay.
What?
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Anytime.
Can I ask you a question?
That's correct.
American currency.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
What did the beer cost?
Squatted it.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
Yep, except a name for this place.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
Why don't we go together?
No, not yet.
You're all bloody useless.
What?
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Tell me some bad news?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
And if you're wrong.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Good, what's his number?
Here!
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Turn around quick!
So am I.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Whatever!
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Fernet and tonic.
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Thanks.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
Fuck you!
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
A drill, what are you up to?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
You bastard!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
It could help with a new car --
No. I won't be long.
I meant he's a doctor.
That'd be something.
Now it's okay?
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I need to whizz.
York Ave.
I don't make small talk --
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
This play -- ?
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Kinda. Yeah.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The dirty snowball at its core.
It's not.
Prove it.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Why not?
I wanted this to be a date.
I have to get you home by one.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
No.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Loved?
Twice a year.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Hoped for it.
What about your father?
Me.
Where? Why?
I don't want to come here anymore.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
No.
Like what, sir?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
I'd do that --
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
When do I get time for me?
Are you?
Where's your old man?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Seventeen.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
Okay, then!
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Five cents, please.
What year?
Marty.
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
You did what?!?
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
What? 
What did you do to your hair?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Yeah? Why not?
Can I be honest?
Nothing.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't care.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Just looking.
Yeah.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
I'm serious.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
How about over here?
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yes?
No.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Yes.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
To get my guns.
It's kinda hard this way.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Better than him.
Pictures don't lie.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Flying to Cambodia.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
...Who is this?
Garland, it's me.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Who?
He's a great writer –
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Yes... Isn't it?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Pictures! Jesus!
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Charlie. How are you.
Seen a doctor?
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
That's all right, really –
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
So they say.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
No... no...
Why don't we go to your room-
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I believe you – I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Yes sir, they –
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
Yeah.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Would that be good enough for ya?
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
When did you start drinking again?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
Thank you.
Who?
Who?
What was she like in school?
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
Are you arresting me?
I quit.
Why not?
There's a name from the past.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
No.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
It hurts.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
What happens to them?
Why?
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Were there ever any suspects?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Routine.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
Hallelujah.
I got tired of being played with.
What is it you got between you?
Somethin', though.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I went over last night, too.
I feel fine!
Catherine told me what was in it.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
And you volunteered.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
On what basis?
Can there be some mistake?
I'm a painter, too.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Ignorant art?
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
You should talk to him about this.
I know.
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
You mean like an ape?
Not what?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
About what?
Oh – you mean black people!
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
I ain't John Henry.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
Party girls? Can I call you?
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
What's wrong with me?
A present I picked up for you.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
So what?
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
I'm -- sorry, I --
What're you really after?
Maybe you're right.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Treat to be here.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
And the truth frightened her?
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Silent night, violent night...
All is shrill, all is blight...
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
I recognized the accent.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
You'd be surprised.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
I'm afraid to ask.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Can he save her?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
How about, MR. E.
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Wait. You can't go.
Nostrovia.
La'chiem.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
Not much.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Fast work. You just moved here.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Who is it?
I got family. ...Please.
What say we flip for it?
About what?
You're a genius.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
What are you talking about?
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
... A hundred and eight?
I won't let you have it.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
... Looks like a convention.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
WHAT??
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Great. How??
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Right first time.
What?  What?
oh dear.
What happened?!!!
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
How the hell should I know?
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
Nope.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Me first?
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
She sure does.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
No, Jane.
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
How's your arm?
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Maybe this is heaven.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
Wait.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We were trying to scare your mother.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
No.  What's wrong?
You're the dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I want to be dead too.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Yes.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
Good girrrl!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Your qu...?  But you're...
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
I thought I saw something.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Why not?
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Oh, fine.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Your family doctor?
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
No. I like it here.
Hello, Eve.
Yes.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
So am I, Eve.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes. I like that very much.
Yes. You look very sick.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
I like to watch.
I want to tell Eve.
Hello, Ronald.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Yes. It is.
Yes. That is surprising.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Compensated...?
1952...?
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
But you won't sign, correct?
... Oh, really...
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Sid, it's useless!
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Right, Chief.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Mr. Gardiner...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Yeah.
Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!
Tell your friends.
Enjoy.
Which one is Elijah again?
I was worried.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
No they're not.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
We?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
A better friend.
I'm sorry for everything.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Forget it.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Emily Dickinson.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
You can be John Malkovich.
Vegas? What'd you think?
But I think I have another plan.
Why are you being like this?
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Thank you, Floris.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
When?
I love you, Lotte.
Maxine...
Never heard of it.
Mr. Malkovich?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Here, let me carry that.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Baby, don't be like that.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I will.
Oh.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
He ask, I give him anything.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
That's so.
No, You looking good.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Shit.
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Yeah, it sucks.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
Yeah, but we're--
I am the Walrus.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Far out.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And was there anything of value in the car?
I'm unemployed.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
What's your drink, Dude?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Take a look at this, sir.
Yeah, but what about--
And please don't call her my mother.
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
What?
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--
Theodore Herzel.
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Hey Walter--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Walter, please--
Aw, fuck it.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Uh-huh.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
It's a heart attack.
Wha. . . Donny--
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Walter!
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
What?
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not good.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Thought you were dead.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
You experimented on your own, son?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Going on twenty years now.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Wait.
Watch me.
You're blind --
There are other ways to see. Sit.
"The Blood Tide".
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
It worked, didn't it?
He didn't. Get over it.
What do you see here?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
You get used to the darkness.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Fight him --
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
He is an abomination!
Someone who's sick of living off scraps. The coming age belongs to us, not the humans!  When the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
We weren't sure we could trust you.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Yes.
What're you doing there?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Let's talk to your husband--
--Christ almighty--
Then there she blows.
That's a joke?
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
I don't know.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I guess, yeah.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
I know, I know.
--hours before--
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
Try a long walk.
What?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
--and we brought it back with us!
And what's your excuse for being here?
He'll never know.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
Shoot.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
She's far from "fine."
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
No.
Well I do...
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Huh?
Thanks.
...Mm-hmm.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
What the hell happened, Ray?
Remy.
We don't seem to be communicating--
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
What's the matter?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Got a job for you.
You're an idiot.
...What?
I don't know, didn't he call?
What.
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Hello, daddy.
Yes, but.
Those are my breasts.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Nobody.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
No.
Sure I'm alright. 
It's okay. It's okay.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
No.
Yes.
You. what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I think I better go.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
They hurt his head.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yes. I do.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Yeah. but.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What did you see?
. Actually. I've been in twice.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Okay, Sandy.
Okay. okay.
Yeah.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
You didn't tell him about me?
What is it?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Yes.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
What?
Nothing. I'm fine.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
No. No thank you.
I'll get a coat for her.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Where do you guys want to count?
On the plane.
You happy, baby?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
No.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
What's that?
Ah, yes.  The murder.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
I need you to go to Miami.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
Just a friend.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
Mexico.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Who's the cheapskate?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
Tough spot.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Good.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
What do you guys want?
I don't think so.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
How are you doing?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
California, huh?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Yes, I am.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
Stoned?
Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
The strike is a success; but ...
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
I don't even know your name yet ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Then you can go.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Then how did it get into his body?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
What did they argue about?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Sex.
Could you be more specific?
Sit down, Frank.
Why would she want that?
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
She was here?
Intense.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
Can you give the court an example?
What did she say?
Cocaine.
No.
I was angry.
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
What did you prescribe for her?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What changed?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes.
A.M -- or P.M.?
I don't know.
You didn't know about it before that?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
We're not animals.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
I know.
It won't be that hard.
What would?
Of course.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You're a monster.
Because I'm expecting a call.
No, Your Honor.
Really?
We have to talk.
Where have you been?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Talk to me.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
It didn't get there from me.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
What problem?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Well, I'd like to read them.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not yet. You want to go?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No, what?
She used to be so friendly.
Not this kind of heat.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
After the divorce.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
WHAT!
Not at all.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
What's he like?
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
Why, do you think?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I don't think you're normal.
Why did you stop?
No. I'll do them later.
No. I was just... No.
Oh, sure. Great.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes.
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Near the church.
I bet you could do a book.
No. I couldn't.
Long day. Go to sleep.
No.
Where you going?
Okay.
They're not going to find her!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
WHAT!
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Spooked?
Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
You moved into this block?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
You got the shit?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Shit, that was fast.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
But the place burned to the ground.
Moe's terms.
Ours!
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
What we have to do is call the police.
Here, put this in his mouth.
You want to get into this now?
Admit what?
Open the case!
No!
I can't.  I can't.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
What are you going to do with it?
What are you talking about?
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
Shut up, Violet!
You know he would have done you, too.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Good idea.
Five.
I should be going.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Me?  Why?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You did the right thing.
Caesar is your husband?
He said you lost something.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
Yes, it is.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
I guess I wanted to.
So am I.
Nothing.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Yes.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
I am, but ...
Yeah.
Then what?  Exactly.
Does the case lock?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Don't be sorry.  Help me.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
This doesn't go upstairs.
What do you want to do?
...they won't let you go...
I don't know.
Keep it. 
I don't know.
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Who?  Who came?
Okay.

<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
That's what I'm saying.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
We're about an hour away.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
This your store?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
My husband's out looking for him.
Get everyone down in the basement.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
So now you're asking for a student visa?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
I tried.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
That'll solve all our problems.
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
How did I get here?
No.
...ditioning.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
He will be pleased when he comes home.
Beginner's luck.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Too late? That's for me to say.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Are you officer 412/L?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
You killed him?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Oh.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Where are you taking me?
Well, all wars do -
What?
They'll be there waiting.
Who will?
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Leave me alone!
What happened to you after ...
Are you sure?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't worry.
Would you really, Sam?
You've been promoted.
The refund for Tuttle!
Tuttle?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing. 
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
I'm sorry but ...
I want to talk to him.
Not now ... please
Um ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
What?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
You can trust me on this one.
No underwear?
We are virgins.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Where is she?
Sleeping in the back.
Mary, we really have to go.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Okay.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
The brakes are shot.
How's he doing?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Let me think.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
What?
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
He's drunk.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Oh, stop it.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
No?
No.  Don't worry about it.
Yes.
Yes.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Did it really go well?
No.
I'm not kidding.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
No!!!!!
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Yes.
Stop it.
Outside?
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
So I quit.
No.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Yes?
Just a two-second dissolve.
Right there, Bobbie.
That's okay.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
It's not opinion.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
One year...almost one year.
Uh-huh.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
What do you mean clean?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Me!
Good.  That's it...See you.
This is hysterical.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
Well, when?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  Good night.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
It's better when you let me say it.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I'm going home!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.
What, right now?
Are you nervous, Walter?
What did he do?
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Carla -
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
There's...a body inside that statue!
I'm honored to know this man.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
I know, man.
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Got carried away, huh?
Good night Walter.
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
It was.
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
You are?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Well I'm overjoyed.
Good morning Walter!
I thought you didn't respect money!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Then let me give you something then...
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
If you see him.
Shut up!  You let him have it!
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Wheels?
Yeah, I guess.
Don't tread on the earth?
Yeah?
Maybe.
Mmmnkay.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
'Bye.
You weren't home.  Like always.
Water.  Okay.
Well, stay here tonight.
No, you're not.
Dress, huh?  What for?
For the dance.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Get away from me!
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Where?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I have to show you.
We wait for Robert to wake up.
She --
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Same one.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
I...
Five.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
All right.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Thank you very much.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
You are much more.
What is she...
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
God, I never thought of that.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
it's okay..
You don't have to...
I want to be had.
And now you wanta teach me?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
You okay?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Never heard of 'em.
We gonna fuck or what?
I thought I was--
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
He did know.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
You're a great catcher.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
And where can I go?
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
See ya at the yard, Meat.
We're eight and sixteen.
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Check it out.
Who ain't?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Why are you doing this to me?
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Liar.
You were wandering around.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Wait, hold on a second.
Speeding?
Lester...
I don't know.
I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
All right.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yeah.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
...hundred yards further down the road.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Back -
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
It's me.
No, I'm not okay.
How do you do?
No problem.  Sorry.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
What can I do?
Well, sir, I was just...
...position...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Here we go. Good luck.
Who's this?
Okay. 
But mostly...
What, are you trying to handicap me?
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah. Yeah.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
Okay.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
With what?
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
With Jennifer.
What did Jennifer have?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Oh, sh-
I want you to let me go.
Get up! Get going!  Get up!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I'm not -
Let me in the house! Fucker!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
That's amazing.
Okay, I'll -
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
I really think you're -
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Can't do it with both hands?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
What expenses?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Is that what you did?
Carmine left?
For what?
No problem.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I do.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Bye.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yeah.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
It's what you want?
Yeah. Uh-huh -
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Ginger, honey.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm here.
I am.
That's right.
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
'Go! Go! Go!'
...they're in Penthouse K.
I think that's it.
Incredible.
Why?
Of course.
What's takin' so long over there?
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
So are we.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
How you doin'?
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
Denying?
Oh, sorry -
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
No it's not.
I suppose she does.
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
Winning.
Pass!
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
You can't get away with..
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
I actually got some memory back last night.
What?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
You going to talk all day?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Who smashed the phone?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
26th off Wilshire.
What are you doing now?
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Well you did.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
No.
She's gone --
Black Mercedes, 600S.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Yes sir.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
You're going to let them get away with this?
At least one.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
They did some great job of reforming you.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
That's a reasonable possibility.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
Keep talking.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Talk to the man.
I still don't see you.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And not a nickel.
Put the girl on.
Call me "Nels."
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Five minutes.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
How?
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
It's a simple question.
Don't know. Who is she?
Where?
Why?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Shouldn't I go?
Did you do that to him?
Are you jealous of him?
Like you're concerned.
Didn't think I could.
Yeah.
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
What is this?
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
You mean that?
When?
Know what, honey?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Sorry.
Okay.
You gonna tell me why?
Not here.
She from Scotland too?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
You knew my Jody?
Don't you want to kill me?
Then say it.
What happened to Jimmy?
I promise.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Need to go across the water.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
I understand.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Right.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
So I've noticed.
Do what?
Ever see hurling?
My special friend.
What do you believe in?
What?
Yeah?
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
It was fun while it lasted.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
I think that's what you ordered.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Why do you think I brought you here?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Adam --
Open up.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
I love you, Adam.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
With whom? Where?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
No thanks.
May I have a sandwich, please?
And I'm afraid we want it back.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Were you followed?
Steal it how?
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
But no one actually saw him die.
Me? Why me?
Next, please.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
But you're -- divorced?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Yes, but we're divorced.
There must be some way.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
I'm not fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Cutting it out.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Maybe.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Hm?
What? Assassinate somebody?
I dare you.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Well!
Go on.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
Leave me alone -- !
I'm very confused.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
What should we give him?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Voilà what?
Up there! I would put it up there!
I found it! I found it!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Yes.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Come on. You can't stay here.
What your husband was mixed up in.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes?
I don't understa--
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
Because I don't love him.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
What's the matter, chérie?
Yeah? What's that?
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
I want you to head right home after school.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
She's underage.
She's not here.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
What are you doing here?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Yes.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
I was desperate. It was gross.
No!
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Mark invited me to the party.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Stag?
You heard about that?
I heard you got attacked.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
That's not why we broke up.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
This party is sick.
Mom?
Yeah. Who is she?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
And the police did nothing?
His mother's side.
So are you.
I'm not leaving it here.
Told you to hide it.
What?
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Oh...
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?


...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.

For cryin' out loud.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
I got, uh....
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
You are not takin' my truck!
Would you hurry up, please?
That dog was mean before I met him.
That dog ain't mean.
Are you kiddin'?
Am I missing somethin' here?
You stole this truck.
No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...you.
I did not steal the truck.
...up!
Oh, shit.
...Shift.
...we can make it.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Okay. 
Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
 Oh...
Get over!  Get over!
...wanna give it a try!
Come on.
Come on...
I made it!
 Oh...
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
These'll keep it cold.
 Aw, shit  


...or nephew or some good old boy...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
So you took his...
...hospital.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Yeah, I know, I know.


We're gonna die!
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Arlo!  Arlo.
 Okay.


Go, go, go! 
...on!
Tunnel.
What do you think I'm doin'?!
You've gotta be...
It's melting, man.

 

 There's gotta be...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


What'd you come back for?!
Who drove the ice cream...
Who put the big hurt on...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
That's bullshit.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
That's right.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
I'll keep an eye out.
This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
Three seconds.  One...
Hey!
We do need your truck.
You-You can't let him...
...-lem too?
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Us.  Owe us. 
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
Let's proceed.

INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
Odd, then, that his car...



They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Secrets.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
Who's your suspect?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...

...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
Tie a fly...

Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
Everything will die, Mason.
Let me have those.

Got that?

...any idea what's goin' on here?!
Now raise 'em!

Don't move!

Yeah, I'm sure.
EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. 
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Where from?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yeah.
No.
Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
My daughter.
How do you do that?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Of course I do. Where are you?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
I think I'll kill her.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Where's that?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Jake, listen.
Why?
I'm not.
How do they do that?
When I do, you'll hear about it.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
I don't want to drop it.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
How did you find out?
Did he know?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
You mean you don't know where you were?
I mean I can't tell you.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
No reason.
Never forgave him for what?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
The Valley?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No, I think I'd remember.
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
Get in the car.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
This morning.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
No...
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
...no...
Where can we go?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
The obituary column?
Ida Sessions.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Help yourself.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Have we ever met?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
So how are you, Morty?
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
I'm working for his daughter.
She ran away?
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Come in, Alfredo.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No, nobody came. 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
So what's that got to do with it?
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
Where is he?
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
I might make him nervous.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
You know why?  She was so -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Are they standing for me?
There is no news big enough.
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
Of course.
It can wait.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
What's the matter with you?
Toothache.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
In the water.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You really don't know who I am?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Half past eleven.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
I'm going to leave you.
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I see! 
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Where'm I going?
Yes, sir. 
Not my wife - not either of them.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Yes?
Why not?
Go ahead.
I'll get you some coffee.
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
How do you do, Charles?
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Think again!
He married you, didn't he?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Yeah, but not in here.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
There's no light back there.
Awww. That was so cute.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
You have a better suggestion?
Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
It wasn't me.
No.
Call the police.
What time was this?
Just me.
She thought it was me.
Pack of cigarettes.
Excuse me?
In a second!
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
Well, he missed!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Did you tell Veronica?
That's cheating?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called me Brad.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
Oh, my God.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
You think things would be any different now?
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Why'd you apologize?
I don't back down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Don't yell at me, pal.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Gatorade.
It's today.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Oh, my god.
His dick was in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
You work in a video store!
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
I like to expand my horizons.
I'm not.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Leave me alone.
It's hard to swallow.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You need a ride?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Jesus Christ, what next?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
I'm not dealing.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
She's my girlfriend.
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
I hate this fucking place.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
How do you figure?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Who?
Where?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Let it go...
I'm going to class.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
A couple...?
Randal...?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I do about three-fifty, four.
No way!
That's sick, Dante.
I hope it feels good.
How long you gonna be here?
You're not?
I know. I've been here since eleven.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
How yo doin', Gabe!
I don't know.
What usually eats a banana?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I did what I thought was right.
My pleasure.
Not on that leg.
Just hangin' out.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
You couldn't.
Why are you yelling?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
You mean the nerve.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Making things real rough for Hal.
Remember the first time we came up here?
A simple yes or no would have done.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Get it!
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
Now you get burned.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
You're both with the mountain rescue team?
Kill him when he gets down.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Been punished, yeah?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
How do you do, sir?
Thank you very much, sir.
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
It's alright, thank you.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
I did, sir.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Thank you, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Well - I'm back.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
I'm gonna be sick.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Blue eyes?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
We're going to friends now, sir.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
Carry on, Chief.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
What?
Sixth is faster.
When was the last time you took one?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
What thing?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Elvis?
...if they're wrong?!
This isn't our goddamn game!
Tell me about it.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
You're gonna cheer up.
He paid for 'em.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
You prefer nights?
Me, specifically?
Max.
No.  You say you're cool.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
It's not me.
Okay, try it now.
It's a mess.
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
I need the job.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
You go every night?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  What happened?
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
Why?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You had to kill Heller?!
What'd they do?
What happened to you?
Slow down.
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Just drop me off.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Motive?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Are these yours?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
A water main broke.
Okay, I will.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
What?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
What's in Connecticut?
Did you kill my father?!
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
<u>Liza</u>!
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
Excuse me?
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
-- Understood.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
You mean --
Do you have a minute -- ?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Well --
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Okay.
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Can you help us?
What kind of deal?
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
The V.L.A.?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
That you, Valerian?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
I don't follow.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
The final countdown.
Oh.  I brought you something.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
They don't believe me.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
But --
Recommendations?
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
What for?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
We got it locked in the sock.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
No. No chains either.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
But </u>alive</u>!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
What Friday?
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
You come and visit.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Because of your phone calls.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Work with me.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
Maybe you should...
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I know, baby.  I know.
What else?
Just get out of your vehicle...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Helen Hudson...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
I work in the immigration department there.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Hard to say.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
She said she'd be here at 10.
I'd have to see it on.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
You're slowing.
Ecru.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
But what am I going to do?
Will you get time off to do that?
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
Tomorrow?
A deal's a deal.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
No.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
Good God.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
A rose is a rose.
Tell the doctor.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Aren't you ever quiet?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I love your apartment.
Sounds grim.
Steak?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
I guess so.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
I'm calling in sick.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Especially now.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
So will you?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
That's a load off my mind.
He's a patient here.
I love him.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
I'll float you.
Do you know who this is?
You killed her!
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Where did they go?
I dunno.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Half the tapes.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
What about the money?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
We have to find Sophie.
Has to be.
No?
Can I trust you, Sami?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Guns.   Can you get them?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Just find them!
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Oh yeah.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Go where?   The police are outside.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
You lived there. You know the city.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Get in the car.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
No shit?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
I know where she went.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
What does arresting us get them?
Thanks.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Stick around and find out.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
A car.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
I do as I please.
On guard!
Do you know her?
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
You're not married, are you?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
No, really?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
They forced me to marry!
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Jen!
You coward!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It is trouble for me.
Fine.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Well, we had talked...
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good, the fox is out of her hole.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
I'm buying.
They make you fart.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
Don't thank me.
Fucking A, my friend.
The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Mister Funboy lives there?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I have to go.
I don't know you.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Your pain ends now.
Leave me alone -- !
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
That's right.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Shut up.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Who?
I'm... I'm alright.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
What are you doing?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
What?
You must take me for a real idiot.
I can't win with you.
I think that's for the best.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
That's great.
Eww. No. That's gross.
It was nothing.
Is it that obvious?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Best friends.
Well did you like it?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
But I thought high school is only four years.
I want to go home.
I want to go home.
Some other time, Cecile.
I know.
I do.
It works a little.
You do?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Baby?  Right on time.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
I told you I don't know.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Be more specific.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Interesting.
No.
Who are you spying on?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I accept. Now get out.
Get out!
I think you have your answer.
I'll do my best.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I know. She's so young and he's so -
She's not here.
She's out.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
I got my wish anyway.
Irena.
Irena.
It's early yet.
Times have changed.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
What do you mean?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
You're shouting at me.
I suppose so.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
But I told her to go with you.
Did you mail then?
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
You called me by my name.
I've wanted a friend.
For as long as you'll let me.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
But she's dead!
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
But she's such a nice lady.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Anybody could know that song.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Good night...Barbara...
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
She pleaded so to do it
I like to see her happy.
No, it was another woman.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Only to see.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
No. I don't think so.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
So pee? Here?
Yeah right... You better go.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
So pay them back and apologize.
Are you following me?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
A man killed in Central Park.
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
They do? Oh no...
What? Is there someone else?
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Worse than this?
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
I told you she was innocent.
And you think I'm sick?
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Loose ends?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
You wonít regret this, sir.
Fine.
Wrong?  Look at this!
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Water?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Tell me about them...
I'm nothing then.
Maybe.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
That's easy.  You...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
And we're going away for a holiday.
A month.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
I can't believe he'd do this.
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
Mild stroke?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Clean.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
Oh.  Fine.
Bob...
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
That'd be great.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Oh.
You got a gun?
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
Just wait.
I know.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
What?
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Look.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
What?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
Come on. Let's go.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
Sir!
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
Hey, this is great.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Except sex.
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
Sure.
It's better than doing nothing.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Sort of.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
A barbaric yawp.
Again!  Louder!
A crazy madman.
Nothing wrong with research.
Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
I'll take him over mine.
What?
I... I just don't want to come.
Yes.  But
I don't want to read.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
But if he said no before then...
From my father and Nolan.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Yea, art thou there?
He's the owner...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Dead.
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
The thieves.
Quite a few.
Anti social?
Takes one to know one.
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Who's going?
So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
It's Nick!
She does not!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
I came to see Merle.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Yeah?
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
What?
Would you?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
But --
Nick.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Yeah... I guess.
Pow.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
We what?
No. No way!
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Yeah.
No.
Merle gave me this?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Up.
Up ribbon!
What'cha got, Bennett?
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
What the hell are you talking about?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Fine.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
How then?
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Thanks.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
You're not pregnant, are you?
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
...What are you talking about...?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
My granddad was a policeman.
Hi.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
Belle --
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Black Dan'l?
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Ten throws it is.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Shall we?
Yes.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You want me to go around --
Well -- yes --
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Who is it?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
There is nothing to worry about now.
You'll never change -- will you?
Thanks, Mary.
Oh -- Jabez.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
It's all right, Sheriff.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
That is Christmas music.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Not any more.
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
What does he want?
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
So I've heard.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Listen.
What about the kids?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
I know I am.  I know!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
You try calling the police?
I'm afraid.
You think it over, Leon.
What do you want to know that for?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
The girl hostages.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
He's all doped up.
I can take care of that.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
I'm glad it's okay.
Howard!
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You shouldn't start now.
Fuck him - let him out!
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God, mother!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
What'll you do?  Come out.
Doing what?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
You're news, Sonny ...

Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.

Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
What?
You the man.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
How old are you?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
You are too crude.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.

How are you holding up in this weather?
Look at that.

Him no white.  Him no white.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Run it then.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
You keep it.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Mookie?
I've been working hard, getting paid.
I can't be staying long anyway.
How long then?
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.

You did?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.

I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Okay, what?
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Me too!
Is that what I think it is?
Shift to your left.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.

Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.

I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."

Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.

Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's ridiculous.

I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!

It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.

Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Who's Dr. Tom?
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
I don't know.
Yeah...?
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Yes!
You know, to make the legs move --
So how long have you known Eddie?
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.

No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.

Good luck.

Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! And that girl has a name.
Oh my God!!
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
What's the difference?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
Shari, Ray feels --
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
All right. Let them decide.
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
I batted!
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Oh God, this is so weird.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
There's a list.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
...yeah?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What is?!
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What?
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
I'm doing all right.
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
Great.
We'd better go...
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Hi, Shari.
What...
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
What...
Thanks... That's ...
What is? Oh, dinner!
What does that have to do with... ?

Yeah, just --
What?

Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Good luck, Tracy.

But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?

Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --

But you did it anyway.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Call me Dudley.
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Homicide?  A detective?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
Someone must've pulled the records.
I don't have time.  I have --
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Dudley, we've been over this.
No.
No.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
What are you talking about?
Not good enough.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Some reality.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Right now, before I back down.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Sid, how are they hanging?
What's he doing here, Sid?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Where'd you hear that?
What's wrong, Trash?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I just called it.
A bootleg...
It'll be our secret.
Showbiz.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
Someone else?
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Really?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
We said a hundred.
How do you know so much?
They come after you?
Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Why?
You sure?
That wasn't so hard.
Fuckin-A.
Tell me about it.
Who?
No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You got any money?
Is that good?
<u>What's</u> your point.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Your stuff?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
I'm not his attorney.
Something bad happened tonight.
He's got his priorities?
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I know.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
You opened the thing?
It's over.
Who?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
It tastes like fish.
It is fish.
DePinto?
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
How can I be sure.
I gotta go.
For the last four years.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We believe he did.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
We'd rather not--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
Merry Christmas, son.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
Who won the fight?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
No "900" numbers.
Usually they take clothes.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Yeah.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
Hiding something?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
No sir.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
No thank you.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
I don't care to bargain.
Excuse me?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You sing.  All the time.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
No.
Will you please come in?
Now.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
It hurts too much.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Still a car.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
It's Geoffrey under this.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials…  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
So was my Patient.
No.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Oh, all over.
Is there a song you don't know?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Aren't you?
Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I've been told that before.
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
So one day we'll meet.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
He's sleeping.
Pardon me?
Yessir.
What are you talking about?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Uh. I'm showing off.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
I sincerely hope so.
Well, no...but...
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
Possibly.
Not a word.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We go underwater?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
That's because I wanted them to!
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Thank you.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
I've got something for you.
To our...partnership.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
You're not on the beat.
Duh.
What?
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
No way.
My god--
You mean the seven billion.
Which is--
It better be worth it for me.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
We're supposed to.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Yes it does.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
All of 'em?
What's your point?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Yeah.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
So what made you think it was?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Erin --
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<u>No</u>.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
No shit.
What do you mean?
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Nope.  Maiden.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
Ten?
Why not?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
Nothing.
Keep your voice down.
About what?
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
What's going on?
I am not talking to you, bitch.
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Uh-huh?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Soon, Lord Vader.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke ... you are the only hope.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Does Luke know?
We?
Not you?
And what are they, pray tell?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Good.
We've got to get out of this shower.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
What is it?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Where have I heard that before?
Would you please stop calling me that?
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
You look silly.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Luke!
I understand.
I'll be back later.
Me too.  I was afraid.
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
My mind fills with so many images.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
It won't get through the blockade.
I want that ship.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
Yes...
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
You don't understand. It's already in you.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I'm here.
It's history. I gotta go.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Which way?
You need help.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
The freeway.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
What?!
The dragon! There...
...to ride out and meet them.
What is it my child?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
Well hurry then, and get it.
And you cannot love me...
I have kept it.
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
There is one.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
A lovestruck page!
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
I?
Hiding?
I didn't know that.
Thank you your excellency.
Hi, how'd your day go?
What didn't he tell you?
Of course I didn't.
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
Want to ask him?
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
It's not important good night.
Um........Stuff.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Your kidding?
When can I have one?
I found it.
You know how?
Captain Howdy.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Cause I like it.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Well I heard differently.
Okay.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Who's in it?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
In time.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Okay
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Be silent!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes
Yes.
You're not going to drive.
No.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
What's wrong with them?
Oh.  What do you do?
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
When they coming in?
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
It was an accident.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Seeing anyone in particular?
No, I mean it.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
The hell you don't.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No?
Talk.
That's what we agreed.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Just a lucky guess.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Two years ago.  March.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
She's a big girl.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
The party's over.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
February?
A useless talent.
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What?
Twenty-eight years.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
You weren't there.
Later.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I'll take the Mallory.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
Just call me a cab.
The flu.
So she's got a few sniffles.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Yes, it is.
What about me?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Nine.
You're a prince.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Uh, well ...
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Save it.  What's he look like?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
I guess in case one year they're not.
Can't sleep?
Hey, business is business.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Look, if you want to leave...
So ... ?
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
If I see him.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Is that what you used to do?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Why not?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Good to see you, Ma.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
Something good?
So you had a nightmare.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Jon, what is it?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Five seconds.
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
You mean like ... condoms?
I mean like protection.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
That’s right. And auto supply...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu “Art of War” tricks?
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
I don’t know...
I think I could figure it out.
Sure.
Got it.  Good tip.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Right.  That’s a major oversight...  So if I’m Kate...I can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I’m trapped in suburbia...
Trouble at work?
It’s not Kate, is it?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She is relentless.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Everyone needs something.
Give me my goddamn life back!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
I know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
For us, Kate.
You hear me complaining about that?
Because you’ll be here.
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
And...?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
Now...I don’t...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
To Paris. Paris, France.
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
I’m sorry, no...
Last night was great...
Yes!
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Five times.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't you wander off, boy.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
And they're changing into...
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Reed, we're running out of time.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Which was?
What?  What do you mean you --
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Phase Two.
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
The Other Side got to him.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
That's what they pay me for.
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Yes...
I've done all I could with the laser.
Oxygenation...
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Looks simple to operate.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
The Wall's transparent...
What do you mean?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Can I see your license and registration please?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
...The heck d'ya mean?
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Officer Olson.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Yah.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Uh-huh.
Hold on.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
Ya kiddin'!
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
Yeah, but -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
...Brainerd?
No, I -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Dad's here.
No, no, fax is -
Okay.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
No, I didn't...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
So?
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
What'd he say?
So... they didn't...
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Oh. Geez.
Gustafson's accountant.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Thanks, hon.
They're real good.
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Yah.
Yah, I guess.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Have you finished those reports?
Does this sound strange to you?
What does that mean?
Who do you think could've done this?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Practicing what?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
What... ?
No, thanks.
Here.
Here.
No... no problem.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Is this a trick?
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
Pardon me?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Do what you like.
A hotel?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Strange.
Okay... Ghandi.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Yes, I promise.
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
No, I'm not...
I don't know...
It isn't... ?
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Is this really news to you?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
The house is rented in your name.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
You want out?
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Paraffin.
What?
Why what?
Noooo, please...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Yes, it is.
Pleeeeeease!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
She had the baby?
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
Who is this guy, anyway?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
I can live with thaaaa --
I...I don't know.
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
Nothing is... anymore.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car!
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
"Next?"
That's right, buddy.
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Home on my strobe.
American?
Nothing we can do, man.
Yes.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Huntington Beach, California.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I do?
Invulnerable.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
Where?
What's the plan?
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
What did you want?
Fine.
I'm paying you.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
<u>What</u>!
You're all right... you sure...
Okay.  ... I love you...
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
My agent.  I called my agent.
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Fine.  I'll say no.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Sshhhh!
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
What's her name?
I don't know.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Well what am I gonna do with it?
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
I'm still scared.
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Oh...like Moses.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
A wig?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You'll be gone, period.
Shut up! All of you!
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I don't, huh?
No.
You got any change?
Where are you going?
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Who?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
That's good.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Very nice.
Don't tell me about this...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Sometimes.
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Like what?
My turn.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I don't believe vou.
I'm fine.
I'll be back later...
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Thanks, Carl...
What?
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
No, it's okay.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
It is true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Oh, for pity's sake...
I'm wit' Carlos.
Victor.
Wussup.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
I just wanted to see you.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
A play-ya.
How you treat them?
I got punished, man.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Yeah.
You're kidding.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
Oh, thanks.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Sonofabitch.
What? What are you talking about?
Not luck. They don't want me.
Full name.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
No idea at all?
You don't know me.
You don't have a piece of the action?
You're in the Records Room.
Yes, right away.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Are you serious?
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Of course they are.
I know.
They bust you every week.
Why not?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Come inside.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Not me.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Alan's in Utah.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Depends on the question.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
You can't do that.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Very good, sir.
What?
Who are you?
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
This morning.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
Why not? Oh shit... really?
How gray?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
I was upset.
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
So you...
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
But I am...
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
There's that question...
I don't need it that bad.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
'Booty Time.'
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Fine!
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Are you okay?
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
'Bye, Johnny...
B.O.C.A.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
He is not wrong.
Mmm.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
You're for real?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Four.
No, I don't.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Did he?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
So am I.
Hello, Frank.
About what?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Queens, New York.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
I'm thirty-five years old.
1998.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I think I'm losing you.
It did, Pop.  It did.
I don't understand.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
Whatta you mean...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Huh?
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
What's wrong?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Sounds good.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
I look familiar?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Same thing.
Barely.
It's Friday the 13th.
Will you come with me?
Be a man, man.
What?
My whole world.
In that little thing?
You're wrong.
Who's Horace?
Okay.  There's one.
Why?
I hope so.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
It's...It's all right.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's what I'd like to know.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
A pizza?!
Jason...Voorhees?
He bought you that?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
You're joking, right?
I guess not.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
We have to get off this ship!!
Don't be ridiculous!
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
Walking corpses are not real!
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Really?
I don't know what to say...
After your parents passed away?
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
Big mess every time.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Press a button and they give us money.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do we care?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
Let's work on it.
You know about Adele.
She's dying.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
They'll lose because they're my team.
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
It's only our first date.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
Two-all after six.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
That's always been my problem.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I don't know if I can say that.
You know the answer to that.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Matthew's my grandson.
A grandmother. God bless you.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Matthew.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
What about my play?
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Yes.
Engaging.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
He's a very sweet man.
No one's waiting.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Everyone takes his turn.
Eleven.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I thought you were against fighting.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
We must end the campaign.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
It's split the Government.
Well, that's one victory.
Somehow I expected not.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Who's leading them?
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
It's for the best.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
I'll take care of it.
Grudges?
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Again?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
You wish.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
What <i>is</i> that one?
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
They think I offed the Director.
They'll recognize me.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
I've found him too.
Why don't we say we were together?
Why would we do that?
Does it have a name?
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Let's walk.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I'm not doing it.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
And you got him...
You okay?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
It looks fine.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Where did you get them developed?
Good.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
How's Estelle?
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Really.
That doesn't hurt.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
That bad?
... and live happily ever after.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Yeah.
Whatever you say.
Might try that.
You were with him?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
Where we go in1?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You got it.
I know. I know.
I know.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Was the steering faulty?
I made a mistake.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
That's nice.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What was bugging Frank?
Oh, do you?
Nasty.
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Especially when I play the lead.
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
It's not like that, luv.
Definitely.
Will this do?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
Uh-huh.
No chance of that.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Still got a sense of humour?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
The gun he means.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
...Polacks...
I'm not?
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
They killed the goose.
They did.
You're on this...
No.  That's absolutely right.
...cower in his boots...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Starting up.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Yes...?
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
Have I said that?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Yes.
What does that mean?
Why would I do it?
No.
Me?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Yes.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They stole the phones.
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Yeah.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Thieves.
Did they catch...?
Go to lunch, will you...
Did they get my contracts?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Shelly, you blew the last...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
All that I'm saying...
Roma.
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Can't do it.
I can't split them.
Because I say so.
You want something off the B list?
The deal still stands, our other thing.
What does that fucking mean?
What are you trying to tell me?
Why I don't...
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
What are you talking about?
Was it?
Uh-huh?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
What sales?
Fuck you.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
You sold eight Mountain View?
You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
They...
That's right, Shel.
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Me.
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Yest...
What is?
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
I can't regotiate.
The power to negotiate.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Guess who?
What is this, your farewell speech?
I'm going home.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
Some of them...
You closed him yesterday.
You did?
Aren't you going out today?
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Did you like your party?
I'm not hungry.
That's right.
Oh yes, the very best.
I saw him with you.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
He is weak.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
What?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Why?
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
 And he agreed?
How long does this go on?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Connie's outside.
What was it, so I'll know.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
They are everywhere!
Good.  Then you're staying.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
Do you owe markers?
I don't think that's necessary.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Yes, Michael.
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Why too late?
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
You said you were Klingman.
Get out of my hotel.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Yes.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
When do we talk?
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Trust me; do as I ask.
I know.
And?
What if I say shove it?
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I didn't mean to...
I'm not a kid.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Your wife?
Why?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
What did she mean by going flooey?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
You don't say?  Which picture?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
It's new.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
What?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
I never thought you were.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I don't hear anything.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
There are straps in back.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh Clayton.
Ooooh.
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
Oh dear.
Yes?
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
You think so?  That's very kind --
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
Something like that -
Needs brightening ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
Good.
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Gray.
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
And there she is --
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Of course ...
Tuesdays ...
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
I can handle it --
Me...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
And here I am...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I understand -
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
I do ... I cut "em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
The bag with the envelopes.
With what?
Just get me out.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
Have a drink first.
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
I can't make any more deliveries.
You're some fucking jerk.
What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
I got dry cleaning.
That's important.
Oh shit.
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Next week.
I don't know.
Gone.
What?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
No, I had to talk him down.
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
You could put a pool in that backyard.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Shut up.
I'm Irish.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
History.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Yeah, can I help you?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Which one's your building?
What're you doing?
What're those?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Who proved the theorem.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
You too, Gerry.
I been here a couple years.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
--And confuse him--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Come in.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
What do you want to do?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Will, your not getting off that easy.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--Well, maybe that means you.
No.
You've never been out of Boston.
You've never been on a plane.
Well, are you going out again?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
I know, I know...
I'll keep in touch.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
I kind of got that impression.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
No I haven't...
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
Yeah.
How many?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
No.
I guess so.
Like me?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Come with me to California.
How do you know that?
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Joe!
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Fan-belt's shot.
What'd he look like again?
What's it to you?
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
Women?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Say, who runs this place?
*You* find out, I can't.
Anything like work aroun' here?
That cut you got?
Why, you're the preacher!
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
What you figger to do?
I don't know.
I ain't gonna run.
Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Want to work, do you?
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Yeah.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Get to what?
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Granma's dead.
You promised, Tommy.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
But who done it?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Me an' you both.
We gonna stay, ain't we?
We gonna take whatever they got.
But what about this?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
To make a long story short...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Well, there's not much to tell.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
It's something I do...
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I'm staying here.
I'll hide.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Mmm.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
I work alone.
No.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
Like a union?
No harm no foul.
Excellent. Here they come.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Nope.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
I don't think so.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
That's going to cost.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
It's fine.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Of course you will.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Thank you.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
That's up to Pilgrim.
You lived in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
You sleeping all right in that house?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
How did you find out all that?
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
What about him?
Yeah?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I don't care.
I didn't know I had to.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
No, you just act like you do.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Tom?
Well, now you know what it feels like.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
That's not true.
Sure.
Tom's gone.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Hi.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Okay.
No.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Okay.
Take your time.
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Yes, it does.
Promise?
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
That's what some folks say.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
I just could never say it!
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
NO!
We still have a way to go.
I understand...
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Alright sir.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
What is it with this guy?
That's far out!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
No. No one special.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
It nibbles. You see this?
Yeah! Sure.
I said give me time.
I'm Crash Override.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
I have to tell you something.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
You what?
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
It's my subway defense system.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
I'm trying to help you.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Just one moment.
I'll take you down there.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Go!
You guys always look great.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
I'm not calling the fire department.
I can see this is useless.
Check him out.
Do you love me Rachel?
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
In a second.
I thought you said you were ready.
Oh Rachel!
Then we'll be safe?
No.
Just do it.
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Right here, Ben.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
Least I'm not alone.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
What?
Huh?
Okay. Bye.
I've already lost it.
He can still watch.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Here, Lester.
I don't know.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
YEAH?
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
I'll check back in an hour.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Is Annie around?
Sure.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
What does that mean?
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Oh, listen...
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
A lot of works.
Great.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Hmm?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
What time do you get off?
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Yeah?
Ohhhh!
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Uh, yes!
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Bye.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Did you ever read this one--?
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
I didn't sleep all night.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I want one with you.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
What are you going to use for money?!
I'm saying it now!
So you met somebody else?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Hello?
But not you.
But you don't have any symptoms!
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
You've outdone yourself.
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
How are you?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
That's a beauty!
Well, then a third opinion.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I want to experience childbirth.
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Yeah.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
You want some?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
I'm fine.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
You're kidding me.
Oh.  Oh.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Tch.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
It's a growth business.
...very good.
Say it in English.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Seen what, sir..?
Show me the Pigs.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
Mmm...
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
...standard issue...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
I said sometime it gets so...
How's your <u>child</u>?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I have had the honor. 
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
We got KittyKat...
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
...not to turn around.
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Dottore Fanelli...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
That's right.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
You have no idea. Now run away.
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
You're all making me blush...
That wants to be a Yes.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
How do you mean?                                            ]
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Not now, Wendy.
Hey, don't run away now.
Because you're an idiot.
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Very very. The photographs?
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Heather.
Give it up girl!
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
How very.
Yeah, great.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Next channel, darling.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Did to.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Get a job.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
What does old Stew want?
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
That's enough, Yvonne!
hurries over.
looks startled at the outburst.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
Yes . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
I'm all over it.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
The way you just looked at me...
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Eighty third most common.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
Zero's a number right?
What's that?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
This isn't happening.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Who the hell are you talking to?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Really?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
I got your bail continued.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
Uh, no.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Read it.  It'll be fine.
That's not what I mean...
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Helluva story!
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
Hello, Mister Wallace.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
What toys do you have?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
-- hospital.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Aw, okay.
Holly -- that's not so.
He'll never appreciate it more.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
He made, you know, a remark.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Did you lock the garage door?
There might be some extras in the garage.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
That's not the case.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
What for, dickweed?
-- A man.
Get on the other side of that.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
They appear to be authentic.
Lieutenant.
No.
Is that it?
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
What?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
France.
What worries you?
No -- after you.
Different places.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Why not?
I cannot explain.
What are you hoping to find inside?
Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
New York is dangerous place.
I'm interested in mythology.
Why don't you tell me.
Why not?
So?
On the back it has--
How did you know that?
How could they get by him?
What's that next to him?
It has to be.
I know, Paul.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
What will you do?
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Get to work.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
The best.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Okay.
Let me come get him.
We don't have time!
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
You have his address?
You fucked up, Glen.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What I want is to help my father.
Stop it.
How can we get out?
Yes.
Just one question.  Please.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
They've been in there all day.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
Where are you right now?
I think so.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Can you get into the office?
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
No!  They're right here --
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Your phony FBI assholes.
We, who is we?
Leave it to me.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
The United Nations are still here.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Whiskey?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
How so.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
For supplies, you drive.
I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
That will take time.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
One thousand francs.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Your brother's here?
Of course.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Get in.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
We have been abandoned.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Why?
It was substantial.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen!
Please, please try one more time.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Who is this Simon?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Not at all!
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
It's not going to let us out!
And we get this money when?
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
-- where the hell were you?
Back where?
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
It's succeeding!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Jesus!
So where's the party?
I hope not.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- I pose you the same question --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
What's going on?
Believe me, we need to.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
You say you saw some activity here?
It might have been her mother.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Sure.
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Good night daddy.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Whatever you say.
I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
Ok...
What's happening!
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
It was a shame.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Your apartment.
Oh yeah ...
Sorry.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Yes.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
I laughed, I cried.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
You sound disappointed.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Last rites, sister?
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
I'm going to find out.
God go with you, sister.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Oh, you read that.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
Trust Leonardo....
I got my planet back.
Baseball, why?
Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
Sharp.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Adenoids?
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Please! Norville!
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Let me look.
Every year?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Consider this my resignation --
Huh?!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Yeah, but, buddy --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Say, that was a swell idea!
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Yessir.
Wait a minute!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
She is!
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
You mean a figurehead.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Where were you trained?
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Of course, Wes.
But she's not dead, Wes.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
Of course not!
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Yes.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
Why?
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Gotcha.
Why shouldn't she be?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
What?
See for yourself.
I have no idea.
That this was going to be a key party?
Damn it, Ben --
What?
What you been up to?
You know, dah--
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
But what?
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
Darn it, Dave.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Yeah. You?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Social work?
Educated guess.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
But not too ashamed.
That I will indeed.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Flame on, asshole.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't know.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Her name's Libbets.
Mikey was looking for you.
That's all, for now.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
We already did.
But there wasn't any...
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Byrd's dead.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
What I saw?
I told her to come.
And something else that might interest you.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
That's right.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
Ran like hell to go to him...
She didn't tell me.
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Your lips, they didn't move.
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Your lover.
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
How he must have loved you.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
But you're the fairest by far.
And if I cut my hair again?
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
What plans?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Love?
Never.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
NO!!!!!
How do you mean, start?
But why do you want me?
Dying?
It can't be...
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
I know. Let her alone.
That and more.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
It's just a room...
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
You can't look at them...
He did it to make you stay with him!
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
A child who can't die...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
We haven't exchanged anything.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
No.
But, he said he'd try.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Don't even think about it.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Why are you being like this?
Can't what?
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
It's okay.
Never do that again.
I don't know.
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
How's Julie?
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Not anymore.
Must have missed the sign.
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
Good winds and bad winds!
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
That your father and I ——
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Theodosia.
I can't understand that.
We have no time for that.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
I'm hurrying.
Don't . . . George?
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Thanks.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
No.
Yes, sir.
Aw, forget it.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
What's that?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
How do you do.
That way, huh?
All of it?
The whole town's gone crazy.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Have you notified the police?
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, what about all your other friends?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Well, why don't you say it?
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Didn't you tell her?
Tuesday.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
Back down!
Good.  It's terrible.
They're moving pretty fast.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
In here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Do I have to?
I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Oh, c'mon.
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Too late, it's written.
Is that what it is?
What's that supposed to mean?
The what?
And sound.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Late.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
It's good with coffee.
So's a donut.
What're you guys doing today?
Terrific.
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Did he raise the Kids?
Great!
3:30.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Mike?  Our Mike?
What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Figure they split?
Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Sean, baby, please....
You always go with Andy.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Yeah.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, you're tired.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Hi, baby.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
They just wanted to say hello.
Yes.
You don't.
It's too soon to move him.
Michael, take deep breaths.
You wanted to know about a cave?
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
Me.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Why?
Philip.
Believe me, I am.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
I should have never listened to Calvin.
I don't know, it depends.
Sure am.
And alone.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Hold still, damn it!
I thought I was your boyfriend.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Calvin said it was all right.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
The world's southern most reaches.
It's large enough...
Five hundred yards.
It's not closing, Mike.
Look great, don't I?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
Nowhere....
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
Because....
Then don't come any closer.
What's wrong?  What happened?
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
It's beginning....
That....
Thanks for the consultation....
Mother....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
No.
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Sure you can....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
No, you're not....
But it gets cold in winter....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
It needs more time to charge.
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Where the hell's the beer...?
They put bombs on dolphins....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
When I invited you...
Lots of times....
What?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
What about Carla's gig?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Just trying to be helpful....
'A Moray eel....'
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
When he has a pillow over his head....
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Yeah?
C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is "God's Country," John.
Maybe?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
So am I. But where's my money?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
You don't really believe this?
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
No.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
He ain't offerin me shit.
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Why not? You heard my voice?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
You should. It's wonderful.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
What was she like?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Don't annoy me, Travis.
I have to finish my job --
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Mission... statement...
Yeah, I did.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Same to you.
Oh hell yes.
And I appreciate that impulse.
Will you marry me?
Why do you love me?
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Thanks.
No--
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
Mmm.  Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Very much.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
It's a risk.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools?
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Pleasure.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
I'm not your brother!
Funny.
Can you be quiet?
Just drop it Paul!
No, it's...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
When did you have it last?
He could have died.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
Who's that?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
then we should...
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
Not if it can't dig.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
A well-accepted theory.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Why?
Something must've scared them.
No. I couldn't see.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
But you never came across just one.
Minimal.
What are you talking about?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
-- my --
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Look!  Sarah!
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
Funded by whom?
JUMP!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Uh - - about two million.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Shhhhh!
These are dilated.  Take a look.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
Why?
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Yeah, I know.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
Stick to my heels.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
I get ah - -
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
He sends his apologies.
Why not?
What are we looking for?
Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
Tim, are you okay?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Maybe -- it's hard to say.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
You have no idea.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Let's get outta here!
Dorkatops!
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Don't do that!
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
That was great!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Really? How much?
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Great.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I really think we should go back...
What about that other guy?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Who's chest?
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Video store?
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
None of that's true?
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
Cute waitresses?
Fascinating.
Uh-huh...
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
You're not going to be there?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Yes -- that's us.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
A man must eat --  And drink.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
I gave it to him yesterday.
No, I left it in his office.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
You're detestable.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Why would you suppose so?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
I've heard of it happening.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
... Just a perception.
You mean you've actually begun some?
-- You should meet my father.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Amerika!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Father ... Father!
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
We're leaving.
Native costume?
That's too bad.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Why?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Sure dear, yes.
I'd just be guessing.
Guess!
I do not love him.
Don't belong?
Do you always have to repeat?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Well we're pretty --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
You said that.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
No.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Well -- she's dead.
What're you gonna do next?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
But if it's someone else I do.
The same as Jane McKenna.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
They don't scare me any more.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Well there's a couple --
Someone's been doing all these things.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
What else do you know?
Yes?
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
What does?
What about your mommy?
Welcome to the... 
Greatest...
Show.
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
You are not allergic of onions.
See you in the morning light.
Why does he decide?
Like a principal?
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Yes.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I...I don't know...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Yes...How's Billy?
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Are you firing me, Jim?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Fine.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Ten.
Look, Ted, all I--
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Three.  And add some basil.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
You and Charley?
Please, Thel...
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Tell me.
I know.
It is alright, Father.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
It is calm.
Did you receive the letter?
How many?
I am him.
Please.
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
I do not know, Holiness.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Britain?
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
You will always!
I am braver.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
The Chinese.
Ahh.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Hmm.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Thank you.
It happens when I land.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
I'm laying a spring trap!
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
He never said "go".
Get the gun.
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
You do?
Thank you, Jack.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
<u>Hector</u>.
I'm just saying last resort.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
What?
I beg your pardon?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
What are you talking about?
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Really--
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Let's go.
White perch.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
I can look at dead things.
Yes.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
You think Jack's handsome?
Me too.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Else.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
<u>You</u>?
No.
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Why not?
Lecter said a lot of things.
Well, except for the one girl.
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Starling -
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Are you finished?
Point taken.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
No, I came because we need -
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Then please - do this test for me.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
A moth... How did you predict that?
How long did you live there?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Later, listen, I'll -
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
What was it?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
He did?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Do not.  Promise me.
Yes. I want you to go.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Ottawa!
That is the truth!
We don't.
Then what?
You're not coming with us?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
That's all, sir.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Yes.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Granted, Monsieur.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
I'm not a doctor.
Why Sixpack?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
What?...
No way...
What?
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Has it helped?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe they already have.
He's not at his station.
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Hook's on 24...
What was it?
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
DeJesus...It's got him.
Your pocket?
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Nope.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
No Harry, you can't.
All right, Kenny.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Plank?
And look what happened to that.
Why, what's up?
I will loan you the money.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
For half a million?
Yes?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
You know how much it is, Nick.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I'm feeling okay--
A .45--
He swore by it.  What?
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Go out through the back.
Both.
They fought against the Indians?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
You going to get married?
Maybe.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
We been through this before--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Masons been around a long while.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
What's in the back?
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! [Here!]
Is very beautiful, your car.
We was crossin' the river--
We have a daughter.
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
He was a unique individual.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
--Santiago.
Right.
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Bledso
Do you?
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I've seen 'em.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
It's Saturday.
How much you got left?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Are you okay?
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Yeah.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Like your story is over.
Couple months before I was born--
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
What's up?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
You sell much out here?
Otis what?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
You heard right.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Don't.
I don't know.
What is he?
Did your husband know Quaid?
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Hang on!
You can't.
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
Yes.
I think so.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
Mr. D'Amour?
A ticket home,
You want more money, is that it?
Shut up!
Yes.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yeah.  You could say that.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
The Puritan?
Who is he?
Was he taking a lot of risks?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
For what?
For an introduction.
How the fuck do you do that?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Can you do it?
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
One question.
I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Bob, it's me.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Really?
No, you smiled.
I know.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
That's too scary.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
Yeah, look at that thing.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
You know, eat healthier.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Ok.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
I gotta go to work.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Yeah, like...
What time did you make it for?
Just me.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
You have to tell me who did it.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
He will.  He has great faith.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Something he said, just before...
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
What?!?!
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Then why are you here?
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Comfort.
We're going to do this.
That's true.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Not a lot.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
He can see you Thursday.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
He's looking right at me.
What happened?
Oh, all that work.
Pants.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
She's alright.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
What'd you do?
Shh.  It's okay.
You might be the only one with a job.
No.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
So how's the job going?
Just wanted to say good game.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
Thanks.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
You do act different.
Five seconds.
I know this.  What do you want?
Your hot-ass temper.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I don't.
Good.
You don't look half-bad.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
I know, right?
I said fine.
What the hell's going on?
Cheap date.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
You don't think so?
Few days ago.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Oh yeah?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
He tore his ACL.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
You hearing me?
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Okay...
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
You ok?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
What kind of Cancer?
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I don't wanna talk to you.
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
No.
ok.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
You won't.  You won't have to.
...yeah...
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
Yeah.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Cynthia?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Son, please, now....
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
I paid you back.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
...ah...
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Is this 509-9027?
Is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
This isn't meant --
Not really.
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
And what did your parents do?
She's my mother.
people die.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Where does that name come from?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Is Linda here?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Been drinkin' today?
Did your wife find out?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
Are you alright?
I'm drinking.
-- did she talk to you?
It's not really pain.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Yeah.
No one else that I know?
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Maybe...I don't...
Yes you do.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
Where will the money go?
You need to sober up.
Shut the fuck up.
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
We need more dog food --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Making the key to the throne.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
A body.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Yes, and he has a choice!
Three days.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
But --
But --
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
Who does?
It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
What is that?
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Who came?
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Your Majesty has had many women --
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
He is my brother.
I must insist, Sire.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
I... we are humble people...
Yeah?
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you think?
Great. Well that changes a lot...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
A bank?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Hop in.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
It was you who did the asking.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
I'll pick you up in...
That's narrow?
How do I know?!
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
What?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I'll see you later. All right?
No!
Yes...
Yes.
Yes?
Hi, Linda. ..
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
What would you call him?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Tell me about yourself.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Pretty well.
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
George, I hate sitcoms.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
That's alright.  Where...?
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
But wasn't it funny?
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
No thanks.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
Oh, it's open.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
They're asking for it.
It is apparently not working.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
There!
Bob Gorsky.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
You all look the same to me.
No way.  Not possible.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
The Matrix isn't real!
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
No, it's all right.
What happened to them?
Yes.
But what if...?
... Yes.
It's an honor.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Do you want to know what it is?
This can't be...
You -- you're too fast.
Because... I didn't think I would?
What's going on?
She would say she knows enough.
How does she know?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
And she's never wrong.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
But what?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
What do you mean, without him?
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
What?
She told me...
We have to!
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
I believe I can bring him back.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Duck!
Thanks.
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Look fella...this is private...
Well the guy over there said...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Salute!!!
'Thou art then a king?'
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Should I slap him?
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
Whatever.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Stripper?
Chinese food?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
What did he do?
An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
Maybe, who knows.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
It's still sick.
A paper on that one too?
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Yeah, I think so.
You mean it's heisted.
This is a heisted car!
Shut up.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
We've got some things to discuss.
From the Korean War.
That's okay, Daddy.
Annie made them.
Who's Annie?
Both.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
Yes.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
Me, too.
Glad I could be of some help.
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
I don't care.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I know.  Gum up the works.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah, that's what he said.
'It's up to Joe'?
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Nuthin'.
I didn't know that.
How did you meet?
But she loves you?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
I'm sorry.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I don't have any.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Yes.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I appreciate you --
I don't know.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Has her pain abated?
I loved it.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
No.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good night to you, Bill.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
What do you mean?
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
I'll be the judge of that.
This universe?
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Yes?
I was just asking, Bill.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Those were my words, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
Death!
That's me.
And then --?
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Thank you, Quince.
Yes, I believe I do.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Yeah.  I guess so.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
I don't know, I can't say --
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I'm sorry.
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
But we've got time.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
That's it?
I'm sorry... um... ?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
Hi, Leonard.
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Tell me about her again.
I wasn't helping you for money.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
What are you gonna do?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Somebody's come. Already.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Why not?
I don't know.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
It's good.
Mr Gammell?
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
No! Should I?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Fucking hope not.
Give me your keys.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
How do you know this?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
No, you won't.
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
Why would I have a gun?
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Oh, yeah...
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Tell them what you want.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
25% discount on the load.
Okay.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I insist.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, viejo.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
When?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
On my way back...
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Havana, Cuba...?
I am asking.  You to me.
I would never doubt you.
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Twenty on my man...
That's right.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
Where's Riccardo?
White supremacist types.
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
I'm scared.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You're what?
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
Gin's okay.
I'm going to Florida.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Uh, yessir.
Get down -- where?
Getchmis...?
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Listen!
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Stop shitting me, man!
Shit.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Not far. Just a little way.
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A hundred grams.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
What?
It's already been cut.
You know where it is?
I know where it is.
No!
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Work, work, work, that's all do
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Did you ask for bail?
Who got the Frenchman out?
There's some weird shit here.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
No...
You did!
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
It worked before...
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
She used a baster.
And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
What do you want to know?
Sure.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
If you wouldn't mind.
Oh, like I could do that?
The profanity bothers you?
The Sistine Chapel?
I know how that can be.
I'm...
Yes.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
--not fair?
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
The what?
Oh...
A toast?
You really think so?
It is.
What?
Maybe.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Buster.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
That'd be a first.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Magic...
What else?
In downtown Sydney for a start.
I knew where it was.
What was the top bid?
More like two-two point two million.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Ninety-three point four million.
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Exactly where is she?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
What if I pay the rent?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
- torque wrench.
Listen to what?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
You don't trust me.
Affirmative.
It's going to be okay.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Very.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Yes, I gathered as much.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Why not?
Yep.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
We got it.  On your feet.
Talking's good, walking's better.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
I'm going to answer it.
Sure...
We did what we had to do.
Is this the only way?
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
On what?
Mm - Hmmm...
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Time up.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
You got it.
What's going on?
That's what we do isn't it?
And a lonely ass.
This wasnít what we discussed.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Thank you, Rose.
His brother.
I want you to stop seeing her.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
Bed.
Ti amo.
I'm getting married.
Johnny Cammareri.
Good morning, Lucy.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
That's it.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Why you talking to me?
Stop it!
I've got you.
Get all of me. Take everything.
It makes you look like an angel.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
Oh no I didn't!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Yeah.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
He didn't come!
I was.
I'm freezing to death.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Hi.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
This is a good suit.
Alright. A month. In a month.
A month from today?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
You have a brother?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I must ask for that back.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
No more he's not.
She recovered.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That's incredible.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
What happened?
I'm a housewife.
Then why are you eating alone?
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Good night.
Yes.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Did you dress her up like this?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Does wood sink in water?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
Through ... We found them.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
What?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
None shall pass.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
Come on then.
Course I have.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
Come, Patsy.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
What?
There are some who call me Tim?
A G...g...g...
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
... You silly sod.
:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'
Come on, patsy.
And therefore?
I can't take him.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Is it?
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I'm ... your son ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
I was saved at the last minute.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
They're doctors?
You got my note!
I didn't.
Not bad, not bad.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
What do you take me for?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
I'm flattered you think so.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
You'll be sent a message.
I'm fine.
It's nothing.
Maybe, once.
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The greasy pole.
No love.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
He thought so, yes.
Aye, ma'am.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
That doesn't make him an expert.
I was told you were in a fight.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Have I ever let you down before--?
I beg your pardon?
Is that not enough?
The question is, do we need her?
Has he been hurt?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Why not?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
What the hell are you talking about?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
It is.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
What?
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Everything.
Put in a quarter.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Right, then...
What?!  There's nothing here!
Never been on a snowboard.
I know.
Thought so.
Then we'll go home.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
Sign me up.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Howdy to you.
Okay, I'm thinking.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
... What??
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Wow!
What?
But you won't.
Can you tell me what happened?
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
No.... I don't...
Call the number.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
And who are we auditioning for today?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
You see what I mean...
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Yeah.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Damn, that's a long drive.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
Pick with expediency !
No one has a gun to your head.
No !
We have to climb up that.
So what do we do ?
I'm listening.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Excuse me ?
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
The Brooklyn Bridge.
That was eleven years ago.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Why ?
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Ow...
Yes, sir Mom. 
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
You're paying the bills.
<<belch>>
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Excuse me, gentlemen
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
We just having our first date when you showed up.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Are you writing a poem?
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Don't mention it.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
What do you remember about her.
You want me to move?
I figured you did.
Seriously?
Her favorite poet.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
Special effects?
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
MOM!
No THANKS!
WHAT??
What difference does it make?
Change my name.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Give it to me!
Come and get it.
In the tar??
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Here's Judy Garland!
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
You know how I feel about you.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Excuse me?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
I'll be here.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
He's so tiny.
He's a great poet.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
I'm sure she will.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Is there enough room?
Goodnight.
I'm looking forward to that.
You can get the general idea...
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Feeding my fish.
Yes.
What??
Do you miss her?
Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
I'm very nervous.
No, no no....
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Oh, Vada...
He won't give it to me.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Aarrggh.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Uh huh.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
If I do it, can we go?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Hey, where does it say that?
So?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
I don't like her.
Leave then, some friend you are.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
You've been working on this, huh?
Sure.
Impressive.
Someday she'll thank you.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
To belong to someone.
Good girl.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
Ju...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
You keep saying that.
Me either.
A bad combination.
Oh, yeah.
DON'T SPEAK!
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Lower.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
MICHAEL!!
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
What do you have to buy?
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
No.
I see.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Third party?
Whose?
Okay.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
What is a turkey shoot.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Can I help you?
Who's that?
You must really like him.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Do you carry door handles?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Nashville.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
How long have you been with them?
No, I don't.
I'm not sure. Where?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Wrong.
I know. Goodbye.
Premeditated murder.
You sound different. Is that really you?
It's me. What is it?
What time?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Where are you from?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
It's not bad.
You think it will?
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Who is we?
Ain't love grand.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Ready.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
No.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
On average forty million.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
The entire wing?
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Who?
Wayne Gayle!
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Is that her real name?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
What are we talking about?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Out.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Well, what d'you know?!
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
Walker and Williams.
She done moved to Detroit.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Just so you do your work.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Your folks live there?
You almost got into trouble back there.
I wouldn't have let you.
That's the way he is.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
He could live with us.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Yeah, that's so.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Hmmm - good coffee.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Uh-huh. Why?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
I bet she's easy jam.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Beat it!
No, thanks.
Okay.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Well, what're you going to do?
That's right.
No, they won't.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Hell, I'm just like him.
I guess I ain't.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Oh yeah?
That'll make the folks very happy.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Better now.  Where 'you at?
No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
Good, because you've got a new one.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
Are you even really alive?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Yeah.
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
What?
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
On a good run... yeah.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
Something exotic I hope.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
You're out of time, man.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
It is?
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
That's the spirit!
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
I know.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
I-
I love the way she writes.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Yeah, I have.
That's what I'm saying.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Who are you guys?
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
I can't help it.
Good.  I'm hungry.
Why not?
Experiments?
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
I told you I want that room unpacked.
No.  Upstairs.
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
No shit.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
I know.
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Wow...
C'mon, cut it out.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Ghostbusters are fearless.
Whoa!
Oh, Jesse...
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I can't!
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Thanks, Mom.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Wait and see.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
I don't know.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
It's been a long time.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
Oh God.
Didn't get much sleep.
I'm serious.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
What about Kristen?
They used to keep a spare key.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
Oh God.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I'm an actress.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
She left me.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
I think goodbye is traditional.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
What?
Don't ask.
Jesus.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
That's spectacularly unfair.
The truth is...
And what would you say...
I haven't decided.
Yes.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Anna Scott?
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Where's Bella?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Di Caprio.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What's your name?
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Buggered?
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Sort of.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Mister Sefelt?
Tell us about it...
Will you come with me, please.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
What? Where?
Shhh...
Hey, what's that?
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Me, too! Me, too!
I'm hungry.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Yeah, what's up?
Just great!  See ya around!
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Potential assaultive.
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I don't have any.
Take you han's offa me!
What's that?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Of course not.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
You're sure...
What is it?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Non.  Please.
Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
What?
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
Well.  Congratulations.
Yes.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Oh.
Is he married?
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
What about your job?
Does Dwayne know about this?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
We lost him?...
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
He fell out.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Sorry.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
What?
I'll be back before you leave.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
And Larry?...
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
And you didn't tell her?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I'm not thirsty.
I wish I knew.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Hello, Edie.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
What?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I am?
How do you like it?
How about another one?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
You haven't finished your beer.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
I don't rate it.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
You?
I just told the Father.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
My pigeons... .
Terry...?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
You are like—
But you've got to listen to me.
What are you going to do?
Your gun.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
But you still hold out for silence?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Our identification.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Such as what?
My ain't we touchy this morning?
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I'll see you on the roof.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
I got it. Hot off the press.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
Not that free.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Keep Charley out of this.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
I do not joke in my proposal.
I'm not sure...
What can we do?
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
What can we do against them?
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
A situation easily remedied.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
There are others.
What do you suppose for?
I said not as a rule.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
I know a Glenn.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
He didn't want me to.
Till they got busted.
You were his what, his box?
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're too late, Jack.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He knows where she lives?
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
I'm a tourist.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
How long were you with the girl?
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You might not have a choice.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
Shit.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
I'll go with you.
In the trunk, yeah?
And what happened to Carl?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You have to know what you're talking about.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
How are you, Raymond?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Oh-kay...
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
A girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Or once.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Outside Adele's.
I don't think we should get into that.
Why are you mad?
You just did, for Christ sake.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Must be a real soft pillow.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
The next time I walk into a bank.
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
For a time.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Glenn?
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
It's a guy you know.
Me?
Can I do what?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
Great.  We got one of 'em.
You're not my type.
Just a minute.
No.
You a lawyer?
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
Got run over by a car.
The State Theater?
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I imagine you would've though.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Are they dead?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Then why are you looking for her?
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Little less.
I'm out of fuel!
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Hang on.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Thank you, Sir.
We can explain, Colonel.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
Boxin'.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
You too, Lieutenant.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Have the planes made it to China?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Good—bye, Grandma.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Just what you underlined.
That's disgusting!
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Pretty strange.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Come on, let's dance.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
Why?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
Just take a look at it. 
You're going to listen to me.
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Of course.
It opens, too. Look inside.
What the hell is that?
Charlie? Was I dead?
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Then hold me.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Touchy, touchy!
Okay.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
All right. But this better be good.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
This morning was good.
Please don't shout.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Way to go, Mom!
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
You're giving me the creeps.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
What if you're not here tomorrow?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
Sure.
I still can't believe she's dead...
Why not?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
He was dead. You know he was.
What do you mean?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
Dies?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Charles is right behind me.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Sorry...
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Really? Who thinks that, sir?
One hour!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
More than your friend. Family.
Little baby girl.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
My lover and I.
Continue.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
They didn't fire her?
Sure. It's fine.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
What happens?
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Something like that.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
That's right.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
It satisfied me.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
... we've got a committee meeting.
Aren't you?
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Okay, Joe...
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Going on... like...?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Audrey?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
But they...they could still be....
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Probably right.
What?
Thought you didn't believe his story.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Smoke screen for what?
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Which half?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
No. She's not.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What do you care?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
Right now, if you like.
Neither do I.
What's so special about him?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
The evidence was very meager --
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Geiger counter?
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Do as I say.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Fine. Just let her out.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Relax. You'll see it all later.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Taylor, please --
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shaddup bitch.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
I got one...
Then the worm has definately turned for you man.
Feelin' good's good enough.
That's a nice way of putting it.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
What are the heads?
...there's nobody.
Who gives a shit!
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
These two holes are yours...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
How far does this train go?
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
How do you do?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I see.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Why not?
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Wonder what?
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
That's an evasion and you know it.
It is?
Who told you I was married?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
What does he see?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
Because you think your in love with me?
I can't answer that.
Sometimes.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You mentioned information.
I've got good ears.
How's life treating you?
If I can get off.
Doesn't answer the question.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Thank you.
Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
Let me know when you've identified him
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
I'll know when I find it.
Should be over there.
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
How about Magruder?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Yes, sir.
Two.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
So-so.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
That's not very kind.
Right.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Yes.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Sit on that log, dear.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
And some of that.  Sorry.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Oh yes?
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
I haven't really thought about it.
He's all right, the professor.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Not yet you know any of these people?
No jokes.  James is in love.
And the Argies.
Mmm...
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
They don't count.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
She said that?
Thanks for stepping in.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Naw, you pull it!
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
No.
Yes, sir.
Zero distortion, sir.
Not so far.
A little mushy.
You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Nothing.
NOOO!!
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Meaning you were expendable.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
No more games.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I saw it.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
New York.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
For an hour.
Fine.
Edward... you got it!
Why?
Exactly.
Always.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Not... quite.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What?
Three.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
No.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Vivian...
What if I lose it?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I more than liked it.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
Let him answer.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I bet.  That was our rent!
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Oooh, I love those.
Vivian.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
But what if they serve soup?
I like steak.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
I was in here yesterday.
So it's to be torture.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Brides often are, I'm told.
I do not marry tonight.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
You mock my pain!
I will never doubt again.
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Yeah?
How many could you handle?
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
Have you any money?
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-- well, when does it get good?
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
You are ready, then?
Okay.
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Yes.
For the Princess?
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
An hour.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"Honeymoon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Two pistachios, my good man.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
Liebkind, no!
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
We swear it!
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Very nice girl.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Wagner...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Where are you going vit the light?
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
No.
Oh.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
This is the old highway.
I'm glad we didn't.
I could stand something regular.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I can come down next week.
The bathroom.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Only my share.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
To a private island, like you?
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
That's it. 
Is anything wrong?
Now what?
Please.
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Arbogast.
I suppose you want a cabin.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
I didn't think so.
Do what?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Shut up! Shut up!
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
You found Buckley?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
There's no child here.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Why didn't you eat last night?
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Well, I do say it.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Meaning what?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
What!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
I used to be married to one.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
How's every little thing?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
That happens to be the truth.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Excuse me???
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
She's watching the car again?
Yeah.
I can't see, let me see...
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
I think we both know her.
Yes, we know her.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
I am not being brutal to her!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
No, sir.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Well, it has buttons.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Galley what?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
She has other things to do, Dave.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Well, you run on now.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I don't mind.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
You think it's that good?
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Now you know what to watch for...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
I'm just saying...
Clench your teeth.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Bummer.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
You going rogue on me?
Murderer?  Really?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
How'd we do?
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Yes, my Master.
Luke!
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
All right, hang on.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Let's see.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
There is no conflict.
I will not fight you.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.

There's no point both of us getting wet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.

Weiss.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
"Transylvania"
Dealing
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
...I don't know.
I think it's closed.
Morning after?
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
You didn't!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Very high an' very fast.
No dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
I agree.
Stuff it, man!
Makes your breath like garbage.
Why?
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
How old?
Think about it.
What's happened is freak luck.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I never had good footwork.
Real good.
'Bout what?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...No.
You ballin' her?
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
To see ya train.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Well, I'll be...
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
He's a Toon... who cares?
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
Ask her...
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Does it hurt?
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Maybe.  Why?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Take it easy.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
No, it's not.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I rest my case.
Yeah?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
By my heel, I care not.
Out--
At thy good heart's oppression.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Art thou hurt?
He shall be endured
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
I take thee at thy word.
Ahhh!
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
NO! Mercutio!
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Is she a Capulet?
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
Of course.
I'm up for that...
And then...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
I thought I did.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Enough!
Really?
How did you know?
Soon.
It's been known to happen.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
Eat shit and die slowly...
Coordinate what?
To see a man about a thing.
As in, they own it?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I don't know...
Something like that.
You speak French.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Gone.  Destroyed.
Why didn't you kill him?
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
The Russian would be easier.
Never heard of it.
We'll figure something out.
What makes you so sure?
That's right!
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
He would have done it to us, right?
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
No.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
I might have to look into that...
I know.
I love you too.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Could it have been this?
What?
What are you getting at?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Lingerie...
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Shopping here?
Uh...C?
C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
A lot of men come in here?
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
Then what the hell are you all about?
Listen -
I think I am.
You do?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
I got my sources.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
El Capitan?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Carter, would I lie to you?
Bathroom.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Try to land on your feet.
Don't look at my ass!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
It's my job!
Who?
You're not very good at this, are you?
Good at what?
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
What?
Take it!
Why did you help me?
It doesn't matter.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Fine by me.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
No mu-shu.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It's worth it to me.
Yes.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
No.  But I'll help you.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Did you tell Sterling?
You must come with me for questioning.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
Ricky Tan?
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
It's the same thing!
What?
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
It was not my intent --
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
You know him?
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
The Feds?!
I could get promoted right out of here.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm not running.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
God bless you, Maggie.
I already made an appointment for later today.
No.  No, you didn't.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
Okay, we'll order out.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Bob will be very happy.
Can you fix it?
I don't and I don't think you should...
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
I'd rather not.
Really?
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
Nope.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
Nope.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
It's delicious, trust me.
What?
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I should say something in this about magic.
"I want to meet you..."
Can too.
Yes.
I know.
What?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
M.F.E.O.?
No, I'm not. 
Okay.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
It's a sign.
Magic.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Have you had any relationship since?
Why not?
No.
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
What's tira misu?
What is it?
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
It's never happening again. Right?
P.  Dad?
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
Good.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Jonah!
It's a short word.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Who is Annie?
The one who wrote us.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Yes?
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I read an article about this ...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
You're welcome to one.
You haven't tried locking them up!
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What has it got me, your union?
Never... never... never!
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
No.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Be still ...
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
That's it?
I was talking to my wife.
The spiders.
Yeah.
Not even a guess?
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Trust me. We're safe.
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
It gets me through the day.
I don't want to.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Not tonight.
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Hey, okay.
What?!
Yeah.
Just some buddies.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Yeah, dickhead.
No last name?
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Jesus.
It speaks!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
What?!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Just admit you're wrong.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Maybe he isn't showing.
...alright, let me know when.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Who's Wade?
You think the rest of us were?
I heard.
I don't expect to live that long.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
The men said, nine.
Same place we are.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Uh, Captain...
That's not what we're here for.
Maybe.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Since when have things been normal?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Yup, hell of a mission.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Yes, sir.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Trust me, you're the best.
Yeah, how so?
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Ours is not to reason why.
Huh?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
What about you, Captain?
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Come on, it's graduation.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Oh yeah!
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I won?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
You should be.
I'm fine.
You're going.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Honey, it's not what you think.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Yeah?
Busy?
What?
Today is tomorrow.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Be friends?
Friends with potential.
Yeah.
You're cold.
It was wonderful.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Yeah, uh-huh.
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
You told your dad?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
What?
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
I know
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
Alright!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Oskar, please -
You're kidding.
These people, my people, I want my people.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
Things are great, things are great.
I need a drink.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
They arrived, can you believe it?
No, no, what, what is it?
What now?
You're sure about this two person thing?
I heard a noise.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Who is this?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
I live here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
I got it..
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
Just for you, Sid.
I never meant to imply...
Meaning?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Humor me, Sid.
What if your life depended on it?
Are you in danger now?
I don’t know.
Don't do this.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gale?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Now.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Hello.
I don't know.
What kind of a game?
Good bye Ben.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
And who would that be?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Absolutely.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
What does this have to do with Sid?
What?
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Show him.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Fuck!
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
Let's get out of here!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Hello.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
WHERE?
I thought you wanted me here?
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
And if you get it right -- you die.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
No, it's not.
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
What's that?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
What?
Are you serious?
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Do I?
It happens. Take it easy.
To apologize.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Do you like scary movies?
You have to have a favorite.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
Deputy... good evening.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
...yeah...
How is everything?
He's her boyfriend.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Have you contacted the bureau?
You think he could still be in town?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
Yes, sir.
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
I owe you shit.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Your front porch.
Twice.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I can cry on cue.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
No, I haven't heard.
Good.
You know.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I'll see you.
What the hell's going on?
Her pretty head.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
Murderers like you?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
Not here.
I realize that.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Is there any blood in it?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
Can we talk about this in private?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
And, if it's a threat.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
It's got to be.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
And so what?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
How do you know all about this?
It's not what you think it is.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
Okay... okay... get off.
We had him.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Big surprise.
Put the gun down, Somerset!
It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
It was, I tell you!
In that case, give the boys room...
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
Just keep goin'...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Yes, sir...
I'm Clayton.
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
Grab hold!...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You were born old...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...
Oh...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look?
Not no more.
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
From the beginning...
Well I ain't one of 'em!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Making our very own solstice fire.
What?
Yeah... I have to go to town.
In the village.  Look what I found.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
I've killed my husband!
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Yes, something was...
Very funny.
It's good.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Lady?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
See you in jail.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
On my mother's side the Ardens
Cut his nose off.
A share of the profits.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
She is always Aphrodite.
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
No, then.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Romeo.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
The daughter of his enemy.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Oh. What is your name?
I have to get back.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
A literary feud. Quite normal.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
How does it?
My lord.
I have spoken with your father.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
It is only ours you can know.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
You're a bad loser.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
No.
Come on, David.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
Not at all.
Yeah?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
Sorry to waste your time.
Well, yes.
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
For the flat.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Don't look?
David?
I want my money back. Excuse me.
For ever and ever.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
What are you doing here?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
And the money?
Oh.
Everything.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Yeah.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Who have you talked to?
And you need your sleep.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Right here?
In this firm.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Exactly what I was --
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
Writing seems easy.
All right.
I'm a doctor.
I write about it?
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Why?
What?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
What kind of treatment?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I know.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
Are you?
Okay.
God, I adore you.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Why?
Don't make conversation with me.
That you're just like your mother.
I am not!
Yeah.
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You don't seem very sure.
Yeah... I mean great.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Yeah, baby...
I don't want to... I swear...
What are you talking about?
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
You don't think so? I do.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
He still having parties?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
Nothing.
Me?
Not me, pal.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
-- well you better go after her.
Look about last night --
Well then what are you trying to do-
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- Oh my yes.
-- yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Where?
Here in the canyon.
What?
What?
What about me?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
George?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Yeah, baby.
When can I talk to you?
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Your advice!
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
Well that's something.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
Thank you.
-- yeah?
See she doesn't drink too much.
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Okay.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
George is going to open a shop.
Of course not.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Fine.
So what's your point?
Don't be silly.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Sure.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Where to, Les?
Yes?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Yes.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
All right.
Okay...oh!
Yeah.
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Mommy... Mommy...!
No.
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Sure.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I did?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Uh...huh.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away...!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy give me the bat.
Get down.
I'm gonna go now.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
Well, my predecessor in this job
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Eight thirty.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Where's Mom?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you marry me, Jane?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
What's that?
Rattling. Rustling.
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
No.
Huh?
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
What?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I told you!
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Really?
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
What about crack?  You a user?
Probation?
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
HE'S SO FINE.
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Pay attention...
Were you wicked?
A novice.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Now you.
Mary Clarence!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
And all those like you.
My what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
A vote?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
The majority has spoken.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
You saved my life.
Think again!  And get out of here.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Screw you!
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Get a stenographer.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Pray. 
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
I've been worried about you.
Maybe. 
It didn't work, Vince.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
We're losing it.
He's decent.
It's brought people back to the church.
Christy.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
But, Bishop...
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Two days... ?  For murder?
What is that?
You need rest.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Believe?
Well... so much for common sense.
I'm sure I don't know.
The Western Woods.
What kind of nuts?
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
We should go.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
In test... what?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No.  They are all missing.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Lady Van Tassel...
Tired.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
I apologize if I worried you.
What did you say?
Come with me.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Use caution.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Turn around.  Now!
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
She has confessed.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Yeah, me too.
All right then.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Yeah.
Catch you later Freddy!
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
That might be better than this.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Childers.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
You told me to come by.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Two people.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
Oh, jackin' off?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
I don't reckon I know.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
It was fun, anyhow.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Did Karl go to bed?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I know he does.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I ain't got no boy.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Not really to speak of.
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
What about me?
Do you smell shit?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
No thank you.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
And your father? Is he from New York?
What about for you?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
I've never seen anything like it.
What do you mean?
Slow down, huh?
Fuck you, kid.
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
She probably died.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
I mean, it's a good story.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
It'll never be finished.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
And?
Those are pretty hostile words.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Eight-thirty?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
Appreciation for what?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Thanks. 
You work too hard, you know that?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
His only copy?
Medium rare, please.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Why not?
Easy.  Slow is best.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
And the next one...?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Objection!
Oh, yes.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Yes.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Fell.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
I think you like learning.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
It is.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
He had no reason to.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Such as?
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Okay, doll.
Wanna see my driver's license?
A what?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
It's private.  Go away.
Yeah.  Why?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
And I'm Daphne.
Now you tore the other one.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
How can we?  We're broke.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
And where's he going to be?
He's going to be ashore with you.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
That's ridiculous.
I have a very low resistance.
You got some?
Half-full.
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Yes.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
What's with him - he drinks?
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Personally, I'm Type O.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Why?
You're leading again.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
No - funerals.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Me?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
Men!
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Why not?
You're not hurt, are you?
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
No, my flag steward.
For your own amusement?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
What theory?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
It's all right for a bachelor.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What happened?
Talk about sad.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
All right - if you insist.
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Let's make it an even million.
From a rich millionaire.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
I know.  Every time!
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
We got different information.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Goodbye, Charlie.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Why, with you.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Mom, please.
And Kat was fully clothed.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Kat.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
You’re too good for him.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
I think that’s disgusting.
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
But nothing did.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Is there any other way to take it?
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
That's where we came from first.
Sure--
Yes mam...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
No, Miss Johnson...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Hi, Daddy...
I think so...
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
You bet we is!
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight to you, son...
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
What's that, son?
When's that?
Sunday...
Where did it come from, Mama?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
You sure can, son...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Will they give him a trial?
What... are you?
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Whoops.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mph mm!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric, that is not appropriate.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
The N word?
A hunger strike? For what?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Oh no, it's that kid.
Guess.
For pooping, silly.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Our moms suck!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
-Or monkey fucker-
What the hell is going on?!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Cheers, Terrance!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
You would know, dummy.
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Look answer my question!
Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
I can hardly wait.
Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Good help is hard to find...
I know, I know.
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Just don't move around too much.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Why?  Where are you going?
You too.
How does the distress signal look?
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Baby, take it easy.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
I'd buy it!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
Theo.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Putt-putt golf?
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
You wish!
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
I couldn't care less.
He says that to all his wives.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Uh...over easy.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
What did you do to Buzz?
Junior who?
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Look who's talking!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Yeah.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Yippy!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
What do you want with my dad?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I'd rather you didn't.
Not while I'm in training.
We'll get into that later.
Why were you suspended?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
...lane six. Yes.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I'll be at the bridge.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Tell me what happened Theo.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I'm looking for somebody.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Who identified the body?
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Would you wait a minute?
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Working on it now, sir.
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
A break for what?
A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
Internal power.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Good theory, Ted.
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
My gosh, Norman.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You told him about me?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
But I don't know how --
He what?
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Valdomet.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Causes sleep.
How long does it last?
How fast does it take effect?
For what?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
That's bullshit.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
It's either this... or I kill you.
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
You hear that?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
It's an American spacecraft.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Another attack?
I'm not being defensive.
Our present.
No.  I didn't say that.
You remember opening the door?
That far in what, Harry?
You don't remember that?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Beth left?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
How do we decode it?
No idea.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Arrived?  From where?
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No, they didn't say --
He's a pussy.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
I'm not sure.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
You saw through me?
You could put it that way.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
What do I do?
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
Yes, sir.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
No need, everything's under control.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
You rich kids... are all the same !
I didn't see him !
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh...
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Sure.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
You used to dance...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
I wouldn't mind.
Doesn't look like it to me.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Move out.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Yes, sir !
They have repressed the Creator.
That is logical. You may procede.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
No.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Sure plan to.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
What's it called?
"Anguish."
Yes...
That: in an act of...
Of course.
Goodbye.
That whole...
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Well, first, you got to change the title...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
I thought you had Play Practice.
"Room Service!"
Oh, God...
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
It used to be the Old Mill.
<u>Please</u>...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
...what...?
What?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well ain't you amazing.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
But that's what happened.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Drama Group?
We had a date.
I've been thinking.
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
What do you drink?
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
You can go...
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
Who is it raped you?
I wasn't in the car.
Who is her agent...?
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
That's my...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
I...I...
Yes.
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I'm only trying to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
The minute I read that script I said...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
You said <u>three</u>...?
Why?
Doug, the traffic light...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
You were in the car with Bob?
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Okay...
Gut Yuntif.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Yes.
I had a witness I would.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Not now.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
No.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Like dykes and dogs.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
There's no witnesses...
George, that is so kind of you.
It takes all kinds.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I killed her!
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
I live.  In the same country.
Or blush.  You look pale.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
She knows every neat junk food place.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Good girl.
You have to ignore him.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I'm not.
Yes.
This is my daddy's house --
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
But Rache...
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Yes.
How do you know?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
I'm here.
Rachel's not half my age.
Easy enough.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
To make it easier for them or you?
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I did it for her.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
You WHAT?
We can't live like that.
You're not dying.
See, I know that.
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Brad Kovitsky.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
I trust you of course I do but --
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
I know that.
Well, they will be.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
He isn't.
Oh, yeah?
Nice to have you here.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Speak English.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
We're not ready.
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but –
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Just the same.
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Uh huh.
Can I join you?
Say, Ni...
Fuck me hard!
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Again!!
No.
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Anything I might know about?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. But not any more.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Prnceton.
Can I see what you have so far?
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Y-yes--
Why? Are we going dancing?
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
We don't have time!
What are you talking about?
Because I'll be firing at them.
It's nothing to worry about.
I don't want any...
She's as good as gone...
I'll let the senator tell you.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Possibly some coffee?
Yes, of course.
Where is this...thing?
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
That's government property, Major.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Condition Red!
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Thank you, sir.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
How much soda, sir.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Naturally I am, sir.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
What's the target.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Shoot, Lothar.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Primary trigger switch.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Can't "Ace" help you?
Why should they call us back?
Look, this is different.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Roger.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
I don't know.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Can I have some?
Knock yourself out.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
No I quit.
It's really not about anything.
Oh.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Jesus Christ.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Sure.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Wait. Hey, man.
Hey, man.
No, no, no.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
This is private property, my friend.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Are you talking to me?
Good. See you later.
No, but I heard it was great.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Hey, thanks, man.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
Yeah. So, what about you?
I'd like to.
Let's see.
I know. It's okay.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
I'd love to read that.
It does look good.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Oh fuck.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
No.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
I hate that.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
What? What do you stand for?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Okay, what would you have done.
I would've stopped it.
Us.
Nothing.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
For a ride.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
What?
Really?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
It's stupid.
Yeah?
New York, huh?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do not!
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Really? What else does your mother say?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Whatever.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
I'm here.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Wayne Gretzky.
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
I know, but that was before.
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Oh... What are you working on?
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
My what?
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
More proof God's a guy...
Action! The scene starts.
You're going to stay, aren't you?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing for Ladd?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
You sure have.
So long.
Why should you do that?
Check.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Nobody can be that busy.
So do I.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
This is fascinating.
Of course it is.
There sure is.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I've lost my car.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Who?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Why do you say that?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Wanted what?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Dressed for what?
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Paramount is calling.
Who?
But where?
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
It's for your own protection.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Tell me where I can find her.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Just like that?
I'm not mad at you.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I don't want your help.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Must've been a defective puck.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I have to talk to you.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I know.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
What? What did you tell me?
Brad?
But Lana, you could --
Oh...I came close once.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Well, aren't you excited?
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
We get together sometimes.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Uh...
First question got to be "Where."
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
A computer.
We gonna crash?
What she call you?
And do what?
But the bridge...
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
Turn on the light.
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Gus?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Storms! Floods!
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
Where did it come from?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Maybe I could try --
Lois, you're amazing.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe you wanted to.
Say you love me.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Lois, someday --
Lois, I really don't see why --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Uh...home...
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Shhhhhhh!
He has powers as we do . . .
What do you want?
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Don't worry, I've got you.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Absolutely!
Go on . . .
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Yes, darling?
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Superman gets mail here?
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
But he's never there.
It always is with Clark.
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Not...gray.
Not really, no.
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Big night coming up?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
You're just jealous.
Of this...Superman.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
You're not the only one.
Screaming
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
You're on.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
I know...
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Tea?
You got wax in your ears?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Lara, please...
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Enjoyed it?
No! You couldn't imagine -
You've got me? Who's got you???
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do you like pink?
It's a Twinkie, boss.
But...why?
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Which clinic?
No you don't.
Yeah.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
The children.
Say hello for me.
It does concern me.
How?
Because it's what we have to do.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
You believe that?
I have to.
And what's that?
What do you mean?
Billy said that?
What other people?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Hi, Dolores.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
We've only got honey.
And winter?
From you?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
You seem very sure about that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
What do they do?
Crafts?
Perfect.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Yes.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
Yes.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Poached salmon.
Yes.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
In what way?
And where did you sit that morning?
You are?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Of course.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
No, I wouldn't...
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Who said Sidney?
I said Sidney!...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
Take a top coat.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Nothing...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No one must follow your work.
I would.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Cool.
You will.
Dyson.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Where you going?!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
Unknown.
No.
Then what?
Yes.
Relax now, Sarah --
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
So what is it?
Five minutes.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Your manner.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Not yet.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Then you're going to kill me.
You do shorthand and typing?
Mine's the Eleventh.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
No!
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Von der Null?
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Yeah?
One of my people?
Never heard of him, who is he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
When you got to the crescendo.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
I won't let the fat kid down.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
About what?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's not my mission.
Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
Ticklish?
You're not supposed to.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
I can't sleep.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Call her again.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Shut up.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
What?
Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
This can't be real...
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
I'm sorry, about this...
Home.
Never mind.
Oh.  FIne.
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Keep it.
Come here...
Wha... ?
Get out.
Then, what good are you?
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
I'm back from the dead.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Get us out!
What are you doing?
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Claire.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like... where are you from?
Studied acting, I assume?
No.
You shouldn't have.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Why?
Fun?
What's this all about, Connie?
How do you mean, exactly?
Really?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yes.
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
Yes, very lucky.
Yes.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
A game?
It's all down to this...
They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Fine.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
What gentleman, Maria?
Friend... why don't you back off.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
And what kind of sleeper?
Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
I've read your tests.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
It was a stupid thing to do.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
How could you do this to people?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
No one will come any nearer than that.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
David.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Anything but Japanese.
Italian.
I sure hope so.
What did you tell them.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You think I'm staying?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Has he?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
What post office?
Didn't get it.
No, but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
No, why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
What was that, then?
Weren't you on a television series?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
That's what was estimated.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Who remembers.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
You ever been to London?
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Fancy it?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
How do you know?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Yeah.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
Are you finished?
I don't.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
That's what he keeps telling me.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
You're an enthusiast.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Huh.
Yeah.
Cash.
Sure.
That'll be fine.
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Uh-huh.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Yeah.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Sure you don't need one?
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
So--
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Yeah.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
How d'ya like them apples?
Yeah, yeah--go home.
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
Huh? No.
Could you come with me please?
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
You're kidding.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
May I see that?
Got my hands full here.
I hope you liked it.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Yes.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Like this.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Get back!  Now!
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
How about lunch?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Okay.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I don't understand.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
It's scared of me.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
I have to shoot.
Today.
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What have we missed?
It's just a matter of time.
What music?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
I told you I can't.
This is where it started.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
I won't be late.
I'm not hungry.
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
What's the hurry?
What do I do?
So why do you want to go?
Do something...
How's your hip?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Good.  Good.
You're not FBI agents.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Agent Mulder.
Brought on by what?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Looking for him for what?
What's that?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Not according to the men in blue.
Did you find something?
You're looking for a bomb.
I'm in the vending room.
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
And you're looking for?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I don't know.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
I don't have his number.
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
He's come and gone.
I want to know where Scully is.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
I do it all the time!
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
Give a kiss to Edward.
How hard could it be...?
You don't know the procedure.
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Then what is he?
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
Mocky-Lock.
Delano?
Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Yes.
Absolutely.
No.
Awaiting his arrival.
Now.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
I don't have to.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Considering where I've been...
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Why?
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
It's all right.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Why?
Have you seen Calloway?
His.
Of course.
No.
Two weeks ago.
What?
What are you trying to say?
Getting around, Martins.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Do you know his number?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
You can get somebody else...
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Here?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the name of this girl?
The Roumanian?
Yes.
Mr. Lime - yes.
What does he say?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Yes.
I am not a bad man.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
Yes.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just take it, OK.
We moved rooms because of him.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
That's the wrong one.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
But he has been there, off course.
Richard?
Hi there. Here, take a look.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They don't have extermination camps.
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
I don't, but...
I have a job.
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
That's stupid.
What assholes.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
You don't own this place.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
I don't know. Is that right?
Female...
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
He has Israel.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Fucking kike.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
What is happening?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
A Jewish prayer.
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
No.
Obviously.
Just a little... What's the difference?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
No.
Johana, am I boring you?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Congratulations, Enzo.
How do you know that?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
... You married?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
What?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
Yes.
Thank you.
In the lake?
You jumped in?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I got fired.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
I'm still here.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
You want to lie down for a while?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
He doesn't hear too well.
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
Again?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Do what you must.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Take a look.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Take a look.
Why not?
They don't say it to me.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Hey —— I'm over here.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
No.
Go on foot.
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
How do you know?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
Disney! How inter...
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Huh! Really? Hotels?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
No!
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Something like that.
Should I?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
To get me killed...?
No. Not us...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I know where to look.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Then find another way.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
And who does Friedman work for?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
I’ll call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Carlos De Moraes?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Do what, Mr Lombard?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Jah...
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Shut up and drive!
Have you?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
No...
I... How long have I been here?
Fuck...
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
Costliest!
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
10,000 gold crowns.
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
Now?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Good.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
They've started the battle without me!
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
To be killed in battle?
But... why... what's the point?
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I don't know...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Guess.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Were you baptized?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Many things...
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
But... her army's so small now...
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
20,000 gold crowns.
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Because... because you just can't!
Here -- take this instead.
Not for long...
I -- I -- I...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
In His name??
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I need to confess again.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I want to be at one with Him now.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
I'll see you...soon.
Just over a year.
Let's find out.
What, I'm working, what?
Can you help?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
A good place for what?  He's insane!
That's also my business.
Hungry.
Yes, but what good did it do?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Wladek! How are you?
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I'm not going anywhere.
Stop it, Wladek.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
In the attic.
Szpilman.
To be deaf?
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
And where did they get married?
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Yes, it's unholy.
No, no bible readers.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
They are washed.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
He chopped it off
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
No, no cops!
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What?
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Then why ain't he dead?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Which one?
They workin' for anybody?
Who's got the contract?
What do ya want the others to get?
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Nice work, J.J.
Lonnegan.
Raise 500.
Raise 5,000.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But what about all these other people?
It isn't any better.
No.
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
How am I gonna do that?
No.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Come on, gimme a break.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Do you suppose.....  ?
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
I can't.
Go!
Give it to me.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Then what are you hiding?
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
How did you ever remember me?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
This is my wedding.
But it isn't bad weather now.
She could tell you where father is.
Not a thing.
I'll have to try to remember.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
He telephoned me today.
I didn't know they had a fight.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Never mind.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Yes?
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I had him out this morning.
Much better, thanks.
What are you drinking?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Maybe a drink would help you.
They were kidding you.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. 
You did.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
Why don't you?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
It was his body that was buried there.
Huh?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Mimi!
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Trying to put it off on her?
Police!
You his wife?
I know I left them there.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I'm fired.
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Ready when you are.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
What if I do?
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
What about Jaeger?
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
So you can give us away?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
They're not going to--
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
We leave it.
I heard it.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
They can't shoot us in here.
It's giving.
Is it dead?
We can't just leave him.
Wes is dead!
You still got a map on you?
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Probably.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
What?
What?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I could use some recon photos too.
A headache?
Naw, nothing.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Vocasity
Don't go.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
I'll try.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
Who?  Who's leaving?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I'll report you.  It's....
Look more closely.
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
Too late....stay close.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
All the insides are gone!
Shut up.
Officer Reilly, vice.
Treat. We treat devices.
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Where you guys at?
Hey, I'm next.
Taylor's dead.
Thank you.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Don't talk.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Sir, I--
I'll do it.
Report on the case so far.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
It's our only option.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
But--
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Smart. London, eh?
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
I would start with cocktails.
And as for you, waiter--
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Thank you, Major. 
Please.
Gaston!
Ah!
They're all right, aren't they?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
This used to be my secretary's room.
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
How do you like my dress?
Marvelous.
Lipstick?
Precisely.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
You're conceited--
No--thirty-five! 
Instantly.
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
I know!
Please!  Thank you.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
That's true.
Well, where is it?
Thank you, Rose.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
So do I.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Well I can.
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Well, here you are.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
No, no! Just with her hands.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Sssshh. Come here.
It's okay. I'm alright.
This is crazy.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
It would be a nice change from you.
Sure!
I never want to go back....
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Will you leave me alone?
Baloney!
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Yes--I remember--
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
It's a pleasure.
Much better--thank you--
No--not quite.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
I'll go with you.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
I'm sorry to hear that.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
In New York.
Sure.
June? That's my wife's name.
That's fine.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
What!--are you crazy?
Let me look at it.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Nice voice.
Maybe even my destiny.
I don't understand.
Well I'm not so go home.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Enough?  Never.
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
But who was the Devil?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right.  Then what?
What?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
There's no reasoning with him.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
I know what it means.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Fun though, wasn't it?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
That what you got me up here for?
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
What're you talkin' about?
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
None of my business, Fred.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Nothing.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
I see...
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Of course.
... Kids?
Three. You? Married?
Sidney Winch.
I'll keep that in mind.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
I didn't say when I want to die -
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
It doesn't quite add up.
Sabotage?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Remind me.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Yes -
Approaching the first gate.
Junior spends time with his child.
My name is Sam. Samuel.
You were in hell?
Do you think you won?
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I will appreciate that.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Good afternoon to you.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
That's nice.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
When did you talk to Harry?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Just one?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
No, you can't.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
What's with him?
I can't see a thing!
Look!  Janie!
Have you been replaced?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
A lunchbox...?!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Nothing.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Okay, save your batteries!
I thought he was at summer camp!
What?!
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Home is where the heart is.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Storms?
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Why are you talking like that?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Goodbye Arnie.
It's so frustrating.
Barbara --
At least she's alive.
Are you going to?
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Oh, yes I can.
Yes.
Cincinnati Country Day.
Yeah.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
So you pay off our customs officials?
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
We agree.
Javier Rodriguez.
It could mean that, yes.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
I have money --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Like you protected Landry?
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
What do you mean?
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
Bit fucking late, like.
It's where I live.
think I left something back at the -
Come on.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Right.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
You know.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Four Grand.
We're two thousand short.
In that case --
Yeah.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Have the Klingons responded?
Let us explore it together.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
He did have pointed ears.
That's a little vague, Spock -
I don't control minds. I free them.
Am I? We'll see.


Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
He's not?
No. I will not.
I don't understand...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
What -- ?
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Yeah...?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
No...
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Hah.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Well, isn't it -- ?
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Yeah, I... oops!
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Stranger and stranger...
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
It's too far!
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
But-what if I can't...?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
I had to...in the games...
I have a book report.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
In her dreams.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Son of a bitch!
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, but for who?							*
The purse is still at the house.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Sure.  Say that now.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What'd you do, honey?
Uh huh.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Sure, hon.
Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
I'm married!
His wife.
Nope.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
What time is it?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What kinda music do you like?
Turn-offs?
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Who?
I don't believe so.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Write down Drexl's address.
You don't know him -
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
So you do eat pussy!
You wanna get unhaunted?
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
I know.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
The zoo.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Look, Dick, I don't -
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No problems on both counts.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
That's about all I ever eat.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Nope.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
McTeague.
You and Robin moved?
Where'd you come from?
Sure. No problem.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
He saw the wire.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Pussy love pink rocks.
That's bullshit.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No.
No.
What are you going to do with us?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
What kind of information?
Do you know why you're here, James.
No.
This is April, right?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
What's the matter with your leg?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
Flowers!  What flowers?
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Yes, sir.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
Might be tight.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Maybe I do.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I don't care, just get me there.
Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
What time is it now?
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
What?
There you go, sweet talking me again.
I want my car.
You got the money?
Let me have a Beck's.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
There's someone in the house.
When did you buy a gun?
That's right on my way.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
May I carry your package, Grace?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
What happened to your hand?
That a fact?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
You've been around.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You know what I want.
You love him?
No.
Did you ever?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
But you said we could be together.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Someone will find me.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Like you don't know.
Would you kill her?
Just ran into a little trouble.
Talk?  About what?
I do.
You didn't kill her?
The time wasn't right.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Jake--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
You expect me to believe that?
They're not very imaginative?
Not before I settle with you.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
Not as bad as it looks.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
That a fact?
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah...
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
It's the truth, Jake.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Got any requests?
Oz.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Get away from me!
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
How much time?
Time.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
You should be more careful.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you headed?
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Like you.
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You love him?
I'm guessing no.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Don't feel like nothing.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I'm not sailing his boat.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
You didn't hear something?
Four.
No.
What about Jeb?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
What about the game?
I don't know Megan.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
We are.
What's he look like?
I won't make any noise.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
No.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
Do you know why?
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
Okay.
And what was that explanation?
Where is it?
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Duke.
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
What'd Ned say?
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Jesus!
Been gone near three years now.
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
You don't recollect!
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
What happened, did you hit him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
You can shoot him.
Yeah.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You're marking us, Bill.
Yeah?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I seen him.
He's dead, Bill.
She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Two more hogs got the fever.
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Yeah.
What was the money for?
I don't get it.
There's more.
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Never heard of him.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What time is it?
What about Redfoot?
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Who is he?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
Kobayashi.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
He didn't have my lawyer.
No.
What lawyer?
And this is why you never told the D.A.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
I don't
NO.
This is all bullshit.
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years ...
Yes.  It would be.
I was her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
We went to Code Blue...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
How is that?
I'm going to uphold that.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Hold on a second.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
Well...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Yes.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
Nothing happened.
Why is that?
...things change.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
And are they going to get it?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
I...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Where is he?
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Right.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
That's right.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What difference can that make...? All right...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... fifty thousand dollars?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
She told me.
Yes.
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
As I've said we had some more...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
Where'd she go?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
What happened?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Judy Barton.
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Yes!
Where were you?
When?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
No... it's wrong.
What?
I enjoyed talking to you.
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Where?
No, don't ask me!
Vaguely...
No, never!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Where?
Madeleine --
Yes... you run this hotel.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Would you please go and look?
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
Ah, Johnny-O...
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Who?
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Around.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Excellent.
The hell you do.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
What?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Just stop.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Alright. Let's do it.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
I won't do it.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Where is she?
The groom?
That's right.
That's right.
Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
No.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
I think we should say some words over the grave.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Say it again.
What does that mean?
New king.
Then what do they have?
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Not really, no.
You will not screw this up.
Ball park sausages.
Easy Micheal.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're not goosed.
How about my Fatburger?
The rings?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I don't think so.
What do you mean, you think so?
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
What?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
It's vile!
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Kiss me...?
Okay.
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
Have a nice bachelor party.
What okay?
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Are they fighting?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
What?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
You killed a prostitute.
Like how?
You did all right dad.
Just kills me...
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
It means she's insecure.
Go for it.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
The wahoo?
I have no idea.
Did he try to kiss you?
That's a good one.
The stone age.
So where to on the honeymoon?
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You have no feelings toward ...
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And this innocent child.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
That's it.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Why the bad temper?
What are you going to do?
You're happy, aren't you!
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
He's lying through his ass!
Yes -- very, very big!
Mother.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
But only you will know he's not human.
Why would they be going there?
He was a computer program for crissake.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Fine —— you want to stay here?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
What's the assignment?
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Don't remind me.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I haven't been working on anything.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
This isn't a game, Parker!
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
That, or living through him...
Thanks.
My guess is dead.
I couldn't tell you.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.

I don't think you're gonna need it.
What can it hurt is they offend me.

Why?
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?

Never quit a winner.
Hello?   No, operator...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.

S'only got to hold for another few days.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
Is that true?
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...

Where is he now?
Mmm.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
...givem what they want...But...
Yes, William, Uh, we have this <u>thing</u> we're doing...

Why...?

That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...Work okay?
About what?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
What? How do you know about my father?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You're learning, sport...
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Are you with me Buddy?
You could have a great beach house for that.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Why?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
It's eleven forty-five let's go
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Good evening sir.
They seemed, closing by much 
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
What?
Then we both are.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Because he was worried about me.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
I didn't kill my wife.
I'm not...
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
It's niiice.
Jody, no...
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
The planchette?
I don't know.
It's alright.
But Claire--
I was down in Adamant...
I guess not.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's Saturday.
Nice.  Almost done.
I know.
Shhh.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
To make sure she's all right.
Claire...
Mmnph.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
In the house.  I was scared.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Huh.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
Dressed?
I never said...
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
What's wrong with me?
The...
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Look for antiques...
What?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Then what is he...?
But you've not told Michael.
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Then you wear it.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I under5tand.  All the same
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Who the hel1 -
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
'He'...?
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I bring her flowers too.
If that were true, I would not be here.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Rowan...
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
You still feel that crazy...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
Let's see.
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Mm-hmm...
- we made a fire.
Lock the door.  Lock it
Go ahead.
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Yes it is...
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
I'm a dentist
No she didn't...
You've killed but you're not a killer
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Yes - I suppose so...
You killed my friend!
What's this all about?
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Yes...?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Astronomical.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
What is it now?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
I mean, what do you think?
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
We miss our family.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Just say it, Dad.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Are they okay?
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
In what sense?
Funny you should say "peachy."
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
I doubt it.
It's incredibly simple.
You're amazing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Not a chance.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Yellow pages?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
But how would we pay our bills?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're sure?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
My job. Back off, Benedict.
I'm just a messenger.
Kelly.
And where might that be?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
I know you do.
Try, Kelly.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
I net a guy in a bar.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
Yeah.
I guess.
Where's this coming from?
Your Honor... Please...
A ride.  You want one?
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
You notice my new jumper?
I miss Dad.
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Hello.
I don't know.  I want to see you...
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
What's that supposed to mean?
That's right.
It doesn't look like it.
You got something against cigarettes?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Hi, Sandy.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
What about the explosive?
Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
My disguise.  And here...
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Uh... how long ago was this?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Where have you been?
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
Yes, me!
But it only has six legs.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Really?
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Private train?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
The first.
Who was this partner of his?
When are they coming?
Is this what's left of your army?
Me?
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Madmartigan.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
I don't know.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Ahhh!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
That's all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
What's the magician's weapon?
Shhhhh!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Maybe milking.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Oh, he's good.
Amish.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Johnny –
Move! Or you die right here!
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Something wrong with buttons?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
No. I'd want a public phone.
I'm going this morning.
I know.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
That's your way, not mine.
That's God's way!
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens –
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
I hear you.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You're the first one he'll contact.
He's got my number.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I will be the judge of that.
You might have killed him!
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Oh ....
Do you presume to criticize the....
Oh --
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Her -- her name is Emily.
Oh --!
Oh-oh-
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd sooner wait outside.
Did they hurtcha?
I have so got brains.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Ohhh --
To Oz!
The other side....
And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Leave her alone!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Dorothy next!
It did?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
This way!  Come on!
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Hold still - hold still --
Not nohow!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
You know something?
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
But I still want one.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Who’s she?
Made to look just like an accident.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
You knew him well?
No.
We’re alright.
...you should rest.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Not interested.
Five more turns and your neck will break.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
C-class.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
I would like to use the bathroom --
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Washington?
We don't know that.
Hello, Adrian.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
And what if you¹re wrong?
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Laurie --
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
What new information?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
With lots of ketchup?
Janey, will you marry me?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
I'm from L.A.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
Aren't you afraid?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
... until he found tungsten.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
What do you say?
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Deal.
He helped you?
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What did she do to me?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
A piece.  Only a piece.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
Poppycock!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
I did, sir.
Yes, sir.
MMmmm.
Promise??
Whatever makes you happy.
You're incorrigible!
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling.
Darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Why does he call you 'master'?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Will there be anything else?
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, just the two.
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
What?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Could be worse!
Could be raining!
I want that brain.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
Me?  Sing?
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Good night!
I know Frederick.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I will.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Do you have a reservation?
Food!!
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
