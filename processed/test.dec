Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
Because she'll scare them away.
Get out!
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
I'm on it
Are you lost?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Like you could find one
Busy
Then why'd you ask?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
How?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No what?
Why not?
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Oh yeah.
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I find that hard to believe.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Damn God!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
We don't need to know.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Six days ago, yes.
The land is there.  I know it!
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
What's your cut?  How much?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
I'll get my clothes.
Daphne, I...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
End my career?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
A timer.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Something back home?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
What do you want?
Then do it, asshole.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Okay.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
That's good.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah.  I promise.
That's unique.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Don't want to film this?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Milos.  Get my money!
As a plumber?!
We started over, you can too.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Alright.  Go ahead.
Excuse me?
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
How did you start the fire this time?
Clean?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
What the hell happened?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
She's wonderful.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Really.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true.
I understand.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
You're gonna help us take him.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're crazy.
I'll think about it.
I may call you worse than that.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
That's never been one of my problems.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Not likely, convict.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You stay with me...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Why?
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I don't know.
I guess he got the message...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Jack?  What was that?
Just a second, that's all!
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Tell me.
That's what I always say.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
What do you want?
Don't mess with me. How much?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
She's an exception..
What kind of mission?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
And the third one?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I thought you were divorced.
Oh god!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
...Like love...
Because...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Actually only one cell survived..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
I know.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Don't...
Nobody knows anything.
A fellow investor.
And they are?
Right here.
What are you... ?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Leave him alone.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
I want his name.
How much did he pay you?
It was a lot of fucking money.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Easy enough for you.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Fuck you!
Of what sort?
I was well compensated.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
You're asking me why?
Max.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Child pornography.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
I'm a working stiff, pops.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
You're joking.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Yes, but...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
I don't want to.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
We have matching luggage.
"In her dream"?
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Nice neighborhood.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
Me too.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
No.  A deal's a deal.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Then we'll find another way.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
He invited me to his house last night.
Huh?
A lot of people think like that.
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
Under <u>water</u>?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
There's got to be an explanation!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
You don't believe me?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Chub says you're fired.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
I hear Twombley got shot.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
We bought you.
You think so.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Really.
What happened?
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Yeah.
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Saw him do it?
He sure as hell won't.
I guess they're stupid.
To us it was.
It's not that.
No.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
It belongs to Pop.
What do you want, then?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
The key, Wade.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
Yeah, lots.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Forget it.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Jack doesn't need money.
Of course! I would've heard.
Wade.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
You're not using it today?
What the hell are you talking about?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
What?
Where... how'd you hear that?
She's coming.
Call it what you want.
You and me.
Who?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Yeah.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Daddy...
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
He's busy being dead.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Well it worked.
We're not going to make it.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Gravity.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Thank you for calling the white House...
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Elaine, we have to go back.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Compute!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
I'm so excited, Simon.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Surely there must be something you can do.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
No.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
But if you'll just give me...
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Hello.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Would you go up, please?
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
That's right.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
But I-- .
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
When will Strader return?
My wife?  She worries about me.
You are married?
We?  You've taken it?
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Fuck procedure.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Who else can I ask around here?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
What?
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Position?
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Corporal Hicks!?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
What's the question?
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Are you finished?  You okay?
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
Stand back.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
No.  Have you?
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
They're dead.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Yes.  A little girl.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Where?
A brothel.
Why?
Extremely clever.
What??
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Why?
Why not?
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Don't be stupid.
Tell them to go!
Wolfi!
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
You'd think I was mad.
Madame. How can I help you?
Really?
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Adorable!
Wine?
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Sire.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Well, look at them.
Ah-ha.
Thank you, Sire!
What is it?
I have no idea.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Yes, what about him?
Yes.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
This is just a game, Papa.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
That's right.
What?
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
My answer is no, Mozart.
But this is absurd!
Did you like it, then?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Did my work please you?
You flatter me.
What dead? Who is dead?
I do.
No! No, it's him!
Yes.
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Show me.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Baron!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
So?
And do they believe it?
Ah.
Bene.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
How did he look?
Yes, Doctor.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Shall I send a car?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
A wolf.
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
There is only one bed.
See you later.
Pull over.
Jack is dead!
What?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Why are you doing this to me?
I was having a nightmare.
Alex?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
She's a jerk.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I don't know.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Do you think it's a dog?
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Not far enough. Come on.
Are you going to help me up?
Thanks a lot.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I can't stand it.
Life mocks me even in death.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah - sure!
No kidding?
Yeah.
How much?
Aw, nerts!
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Why, of course.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
know, but—
Why, I needed a—
Me?
What is?
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know?
Good for you. Come on.
A misunderstood bachelor.
I'm listening.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Yes?
I can't tell you.
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
What'll we do?
Is it safe?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
No.
All right.
Come here, honey!
The ten dollars.
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Yes.
Oh, Matt.
Well, he was making love to her.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes, sir.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
I don't know.
Okay, Matt.
Where's Charlie?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
Tomorrow.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
You are a fine figure of a man.
How?
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sure, cousin.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
I'm thinking...
Which one, right or left?
Get buckets!
They're just insurance in case we run.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Ho-yah!
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Mm-hmm.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
If I could go back to farming --
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Yeah.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Mmmm.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Sparkling rocks?
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
How much did they get from the safe?
What is that?
What, sir?
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Courtney? Dinner?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Is it a what?
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Everybody has a great body now.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Leaving what?
This.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Just...say...no!
Well...
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Next Saturday?
She's from...France.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Coffee?
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Shoot.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Where did Paul hang out?
And where did he go to school?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
No.
That's so typical, isn't it?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
What?
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I'm so hungry.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Didn't you visit the campus?
We're not gonna let it.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
It was a hate crime.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I can't just walk away!
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
What?
Milo --
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
It's gonna get cold.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
What?
Oh. No thanks.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
What're you implying.
Definitely.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Just thought his work should go on.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Oh yeah?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Why?!
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Jesus, Teddy.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Speaking of which...
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Behave!
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Oh, and Austin...
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Be careful!
Groovy!
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
Danger's my middle name.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Great.
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Mr. John Steed, please.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
We have met ...
After the cold war ...
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
To find out who killed my husband.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
And just what is the game?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Do you really think so?
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
An eccentric recluse?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
Strange.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Did he say who?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Is that written in his shoe?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
You're playing games.
Winning isn't everything.
You don't trust me?
You didn't tell her?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
But --
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Decontamination -- ?
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
Dead, I'm afraid.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
No, please! I beg you ...
If you say so.
I do.
Ugh ...
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
When do the girls get to the party?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
She's mine!
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Oh... I got something for that.
You're really pissing me off.
I love you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Great, Mom.
Quiet, Mother.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Your whores never showed up.
What's going on?
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Good.
Really?
Ha, ha, ha.
It's Bullwinkle.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
All right, who serves?
I'd love that.
Feel free.
You can tell a man by his friends.
Mrs.?
I'm not really hungry.
About what?
Oooooo.
Right in there, pal.
You got it.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Be gentle.
Stevie... I...
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
-- Never mind.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Just leave me alone, okay?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Saw what?
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I know.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
-- I work for the city.
It's a small town.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Fire.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No need to be modest, Brian.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
I'll be there.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
There's something else kinda interesting...
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
And old ladies?
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Me?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Don't bullshit me.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
You might be right.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Meaning?
I'm out.
You're in this up till ya neck.
That can be done.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
I'm wid it.
Yep, you guessed it.
Who are the other characters?
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
This has to be a big mistake.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
So what's up with you?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
I'll be right over.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...aconite get it dat cheap.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...too early...
...then what about...
...perfect...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
You don't read, do you?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
O'Grady.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I don't know.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Then you yield to me.
That is a trifle strong.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Old fool!
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
What is to be done?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
May I be quite frank with you?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Who?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
HEY!
We found him like this...
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
Okay.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Jesus!
What business?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Full clip to the body --
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
But not the only victim, right?
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
What about the confession?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
Not for long.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Yes.
Move him.
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Watch me.
Dunbar.
Little bit.
They got their stories straight.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No.
Good, just making sure.
What if I don't want it?
Think it'll work?
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
The faggot speaks.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Fifty minutes.
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
What the fuck are you doing?
Yes!
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
I brought it.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I'll...
I know.
I was dreaming.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Well, it's not a short one.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
And I like you.
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Really.
Okay.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
You know where the chemicals are?
What?
You think I'm fake.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Yes.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes. But that's a different...
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
The sets were good.
Do you want to stop?
That's not a burn.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Good. 
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Oh nothing.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
Yes I know.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
It's none of your business.
Oh Jesus.
But, you know, so what?
Excuse me?
And who says what is wrong.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Why?
You don't understand you either.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
No.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Laugh it up.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Please.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Oh, she older than that.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
She's around. Always is.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
And you gonna live it with him?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
In my house, you watch that lip...
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
Nothin'.
I guess you have.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Go ask him.
Or what?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Yes'sir.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae don't do this now...
Hey.
You feelin' sick?
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Ronnie...
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Thanks.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
The Wolf?
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Number five with a bullet.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
You said that in the last two places.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Cool?
Hey, all right.
Connie...
Where would you look for the mafia?
I don't, that's all.
Nick...
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
I don't know.
Why's that?
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
What if I chant?
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
He was my partner.
You're foreigners.
Do you know what this is?
Goodbye, officer.
If he won't cooperate?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Also extraordinary things.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
You're just all so... so different.
Nexus - 6.
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Your customer, eh?
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Sorry.
Money?
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Sorry.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
It would be my child.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Yeah.
You did?
Oh.
Yeah.
Hmmm?
You mean a woman?
What?
I'll see you in a minute.
Yes.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
Sorry.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
A tortoise.  What's that?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
Oh.
We sure did.
Is that why you're still here?
You like it?
Sure.
Yes, ma'am.
It was amazing.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
What is it?!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
How long would you need me?
What's the pay?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Name it.
Why?!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
It didn't used to be that way.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Thank you.
Yes, ma'am!
Thank-Q!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Okay!
Good-bye!
And don't be so obvious!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
What?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Yes, sir.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Shit is a French word?
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Uh, I think they have.
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
He drank it hot?
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
The locks?
Honey?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
No.
We do?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--do as I say!
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Oh, my God...
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
No.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
He left with Sophie.
You're goddamn right I am!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
What?!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Yeah. How's Dad?
I'm not sick.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
No way.
What do you want?
No.
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you know?
Yeah, hurry up though.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
Yes.
Please, please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Yes, but.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Be right down.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Nothing. I'm fine.
That sounds great!
Good deal Dad.
Yes.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Brilliant.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You better not, Jeffrey.
See ya tomorrow.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
No.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Okay.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Sandy?
Oh fuck! 
Aye.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Connor, is that you?
Ma, what's wrong?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
Aye.
No pictures, either.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
It was... It was...
The what man?
Why was I not informed of this?
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
No way they could have seen it.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Y-Yes my son.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
This is he?
She's an attractive older woman.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Yes, they are.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Which one was that?
No kidding.
This was in fourth grade.
Where was it parked?
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
Would of been nice.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I know that. But --
Right now.
As a person?
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Dignan, I --
That's a sharp jacket.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Me?
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
It's an esoteric journey.
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Yeah. He said that.
I'm not playing any more golf.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
Sure.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
God, yes. Like silk.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Yeah.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
True.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
So who's going to know?
Can you use a coaster.
I'll just drive my car.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Let's just go.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
That's too bad.
Did we get it?
Don't count it.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
What the fuck possessed you?
What are you talking about?
They said he's a drug dealer.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I never agreed to that.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
Jesus Christ.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
What's that?
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Oh, yeah.
He's damn good.
Where?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Why not? It was just money.
I speak English.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
Conklin.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Last week? When?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
What's that?
What? The tapes?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
So let the council swear publicly.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Hamish, I... thank...
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That depends on the man.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Thank you for inviting.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
...I wouldn't know.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But you must have something to go on?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
I... I blacked out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
So you believe me?
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Go on. Sit down.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Because you're... different.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
I come from a big family.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Looking for a job.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Richard, I had to see you.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Put them on the table.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
No, not yet.
Because you're getting on that plane.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Yes, ma'am.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
No, Victor, no.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Won't you join us for a drink?
We all try. You succeed.
Not at all.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
Goodnight.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I expected no less, Captain.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I see what you mean.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
I was misinformed.
Victor Laszlo?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Oh, but I just told you. --
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, thanks.
I have. Sit down over there.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Our expenses?
Take your hands off me!
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
For how long?
Good. Then have a drink.
Do too much, I'll die.
No.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Shut up.
Oh?  You've tried?
No.  that was the last one.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
Had a package to deliver.
Let's take a look.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I would have done the same thing.
You have any children?
That about sums it up.
Great.  Really.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
I'm doing fine.
Can you find her?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
What?
I need to do it.
I was!
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Two.
I've never seen the ocean, either.
Where's Mandalay?
I understand.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Oh, sure!
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
It will be okay.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Well, we have to help her!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Hi...
Why?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
But did you know him?
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Where'd she get you?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
I haven't read that.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
It look nicer then home!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I don't follow.
Everything looks in order.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Well, this is just fucking great...
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
That's it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
I think I just broke my hand.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
We're not cops.
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
And some new clothes.
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
No, I want my cut!
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
We never had a problem with that before.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
With identification.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Goodnight.
I despise the job.
Not like Matt, you mean.
A couple I know are getting married.
What?!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You want me drunk?
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Fine.
Are you drunk?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
Nothing about you.
You know where I'm from?
Well, thank you anyway.
First visit to London?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Toss you for it.
You don't like cheats, do you.
What kind of trouble?
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Yes.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Jack! It's Jani.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I'm not going to report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
He's a good customer.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where is the key?
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Well, there's the possibility of...
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
The only thing which exists is myself.
But how do you know you exist?
To explode, of course.
That is correct.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Naah. All stable.
Wha?
Out where?
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Guess you're right.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
What're you talkin' about?
Who's Camille?
Could you give us a moment.
Yeah, me too.
They took my daughter.
I know.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
The one you're wearing?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
I'm not a half bad cook.
It was open.
You did go through my stuff.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Your basic hodge-podge.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I don't know what to say.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Okay, okay.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
I actually know how this works.
Pull the cash.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Right, the big one-oh.
We gotta talk.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
How'd you get her out of town?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
I was on call. 
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Believe it.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Curly.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
The paint!
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Hawk?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Check.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
What?!
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Good MORNING!
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Theoretically.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
You have to do something for me first.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
It's safe here.
Who's Frank?
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
No. That makes you keep searching.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
I know.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Then how is time travel possible?
Thank you.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Yeah.
Her name is Gretchen.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
That's enough.
Yep.
No more fuckin' for her.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
I love you much.
It's okay.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Yes...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Yeah.
Ohio...
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
Yes, sir. 
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
I don't call him, I whistle.
Yankee Poodle.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You told it to me.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Once more! 
You upstart!
Oh -- you mean... worm?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
WHAT  ?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
But -
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Never mind that, I want my man!
You don't own this man!
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Won't be a moment.
Oh no, my friend...
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Merrick".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
Good morning.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WELCOME?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
It was different...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
No... no...
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
But you don't want to hear it.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
What?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Oh, thanks.
Tell me your name?
What?
No.
Row! Row! Row!
But you're the Gods!
To the oars!
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
No, it is NOT.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You could charge him what you like.
Together we stand!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Dad!
No, Mother.
In the room?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Why?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Really? Because --
I'm Joel.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Cheers.
No, I'm okay for now.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
No, not at all.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Would you get me another, Joely?
No.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
This is our first "date" date.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I'm sure, I said.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Not yet. Not married.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
Okay.
It's freezing out here.
It's dark.
I love you.
I'm nervous, too.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
I don't know. Panties and --
How's it going?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Fuck you, Clementine.
It's too late.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You have to stop this!
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh! Great. That's great!
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
It's a good one all right.
Yup.
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
Shit!
You better go.
How did I look?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
It's no big deal.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
We'll make it.
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Does he know that?
What's on your mind?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Starck!
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Justin.
Thanks.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
That is not acceptable --
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
I don't know...
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Starck, give me a read.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
They're gone.
I just finished drying...
Keep your eyes open.
How much oh-two do we have?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
No. It was someone else.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Five seconds.
...repeat, we're armed...
Yes.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
It's cold.
We're losing atmosphere...
Explosive decompression.
Ship's log.
I can't believe we built this.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
What did he do to the uniform?!
About me? How sweet.
Where do you think? With Sue.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
Never better.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Which was?
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Of course. Of course.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
Hilarious.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Just find him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
How much did they cost?
On the ledge?
Sis.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.
But your face did!
Nice to meet you.
Oh, really?
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Hello.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
All right. Pay attention.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Totally.
He is.
This ain't no cop.
What variables?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
There's nothing to it.
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think it is?
That little prick.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
I want romance.
Yeah, like maybe never.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I don't know.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
If you graduate.
I know, everyone says that.
Where do you feel like going?
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
What's April 16th?
Oh. I see.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Yes... It makes sense.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
What tape?
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Lucy.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Never missed a plane yet.
Of course, officer.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
Right.
They'll be back.
Nah, I got the gun.
Follow me.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
You weren't helpin'.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
How much you got?
He's dead.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Huh?
Is it gassed up?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Sit still, look less like a meal.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
What?
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Thank you --
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Frances.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
What does Clifford say?
In my eyes, officer.
You're under arrest.
There've been some calls.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
...Don't you?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thank you.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
You wrote it, didn't you?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
Be careful, Francie.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
I wouldn't miss it.
You sound as if you hate it.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Harry.
How'd I look?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
What's left of my blood.
What for?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
I guess.
What's that?
What a man!
Huh?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Oh Harry...
Yeah. I don't know.
I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Well... you're looking well.
I'm not sure.
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
...You will.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I'm going out!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Normal. Average.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Frances, I'm warning you...
No!
Yeah?
You're kidding.
I was watching.
How did you find me?
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
No. I draw the line.
So have I
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
I wish to be your husband.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
So do I.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
I resent God's monopoly.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thank you, Henry.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
The strain was evident.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Tomorrow is another day.
I was careless.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Un-hunh.
Maybe I can help?
Artist.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
Okay.
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Where'd you get that stuff?
I had to.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
I call it my shower dream.
Lead the way!
Whassamatta?
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
So let's do it.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Yes.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Why not, against your religion?
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Do you believe me?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
I'm really sorry.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
You believe me don't cha?
What?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
I'm here with you.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Don't say my name.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Your prerogative, Senator.
Thank you, sir.
I'm fine, sir.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Didn't take long.
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Across the board, sir.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
West?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Did you hear?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Do that.
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
I'll try anyway, sir.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
How hard they making it on you?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Whose orders were those?
He was married?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
That's not right.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
What?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
You'd be surprised.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Can I use some?
This is not the place...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Oh.
We know.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Sure.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Good idea.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
THIS much.
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Oh.  Okay.
It's okay. Listen-
But you don't?
Lt. Madison, GO.
I never get tired of that joke.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
All right. Put me back on with him.
Your last name.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
I don't think that's a cloud...
Turn on the translation circuit.
What the hell are you talking about?
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
Closer?  I can try.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We.. We lie.
Thanks
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
You can oc that?
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Find them.
They always say that.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
The army can survive without me.
Same old story.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
A lot of years have gone by.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
But it's more than just that, am I right?
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
George!  So good to be back!
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
I only meant...
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
I'm very aware of that.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Some things must never change.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa, of course.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
You're out of your mind!
And dost thou live to ask it?
Juba was a Numidian.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
Come here, Farrah...
No. What's this?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
What money?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
She can't talk right now.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Okay. So who are you?
Who?
He owes me money.
You're an investor, is that it?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Leo spanked a waitress?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
I had to tell 'em something.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I believe it.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
Who told you that?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
That's right. Three percent.
What're you doing here?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Man, can you scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
You don't act like it?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Mob guy?
Say again. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Maureen?
Roger?
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
So we kill him?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Threw a turbine blade.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Yeah, yeah.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Right.
Murphy.
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
What do you propose?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
You just shoot at something?
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Wish I could say the same.
Maybe it was more than that.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
Go.
How's that?
Sorry.
Ho, baby!
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Who?
Give up?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Huh?
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
When did I say I hated you?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
In fact, never.
Okay, okay!
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
You can have that one.
Oh, we totally have to.
What is this?
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
I can't believe it!
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Come on, it's too late now...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Fuck you, bitch!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It'll only take a second.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
What? Where?!
Where?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
You're gross.  See that guy?
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Yeah, thanks.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Why? What did he say?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Get a job!
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
I'm totally serious!
Every guy has a type!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Jesus, Seymour.
Jesus...
It's not hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
That's the spirit!
Oh yeah?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Really?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
...What do you mean?
Uh... sure... come in.
What's the matter?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
I don't know.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
That is correct.  Nothing.
Have you got that in writing? 
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
You mean nobody died?
Got me out of trouble.
Have you ever failed?
Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
The workers don't get on?
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Thank you.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Good luck.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
I await the word of Vigo.
Who are they?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
I don't even want to know where that is.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
And we're the ...
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
I'm Peter --
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
I hate Jello.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
I'm ready.
Huh?  What?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
No.  They're just coming to me.
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
... I thought it was the drug store.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
What?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
No kiss?
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Can't you tell me now?
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
But why?  The students love us!
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
That's so romantic.
Has this ever happened before?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Yes, it would.
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Wow!
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
She said he was "the Destructor."
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Fourteen hundred.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
No sense worrying about it now.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
LATER, MAN!!
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
Do you want posters, too?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Take grain away from the army?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
They're studying with Cynics.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I don't want you to die!
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Before they leave, get gold.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Hello.
No.
I don't know.
No, I couldn't.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Did they ever find out?
And it's all over now.
I'm glad.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
What?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Oh.
Because -- I am.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
What did she say?
If you want.
My belt.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
No.
Well -- where are you going?
Yes.
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Give me an hour.
What?
Of course.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
That's right.
What?
I don't know.
I'm very neurotic.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
So?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God.
I've got to go.
A drink? Of course.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Yes?
Yes.
The number.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Are you afraid of me?
Are you kidding?
Who said it was my first time?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Are you tired of it?
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Yes I do.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
No.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Yes.
Kind of.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Good.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Do exactly what I say.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Nothing else.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
About an hour ago.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
Quite a while.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Mr. Robinson?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Yes.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No.
How?
You're a fool!
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Too bad.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
You live here?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
What?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
We could come to my room.
You've lost everything?
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I must have made a mistake.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Most imposters are --
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. 
Oh, don't go.
Yes -- that --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
What?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Moreover...
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Me.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Nothing.
Yes.
A thousand marks -- 
Shhh -- here he is now.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
You've decided against the merger?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
What is this insolence?
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Good night.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Your what?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
And if you do it wrong?
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Hah.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
We're not really interested, Henry.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
You brought a case? Good.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
I'll get you a check.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Oh, sure. Fine.
How come?
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
And Myra's stuff?
No.
I'll get it.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
I don't?
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
What?
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
Upstate where?
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
You up to it now?
What?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
No, its -- Why did she--?
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Where?
The cemetery...
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
My god...
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
No.  Wait for the police.
No.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My life is a living hell.
I don't know.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Where'd you get it?
Why not?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
I'm okay.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Who?!
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Guess so ...
The voice man!  He's here!
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Who are you?
God ... this can't be true.
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Wait a minute ...
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
An old friend.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Why did you take Jamie?
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Stay away, Sam.
Hm?
Didn't recognize you.
I suppose.
Let's talk about it some other time.
You ever own a motorcycle?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
What?
You invited me.
To make an ass of yourself.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
As a matter of fact--
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Tell me that.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Mhravitch.
Penelope!
Leave a tip.
Who was it?
Nothing.
I don't want to fight you.
Daughter--I love you very much.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We all are.
Thank God!
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Turn around?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
People don't use that word any more.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
It couldn't!
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
The doctor.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for Paul as well.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
Oh dear.
She's fine.  Please--
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
I've literally got to run!
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
What for?
There's a certain amount of information there.
Yes.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
I see.
Don Quixote.
No.
There was so much going on.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
No.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Oh?
My father!
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
Paul's only twelve years old.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Well, I want to...
Yeah.
Man, how many girls do you need?
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Yeah.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Half now, half later.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I am.
And your wife? Where's she?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
What rate?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
No.
Neither am I.
How important do you think sex is?
They were here?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
No, please go on.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What makes you so sure?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
And better?
Who made it?
What do you mean?
What's it called?
Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.
Get out.
Just leave me alone.
What is going on?
What plan?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
I don't know.
Who?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't know.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To anybody.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Thanks.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Where are the papers?
Not very.
I'm a file clerk.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
All right.
Maude???!
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Look.
Yes.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like you, Maude.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Oh, you weren't scared.
I don't know. Perhaps.
You should have been a poet.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
It's all right. It's organic.
But why now?
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Mother.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Why?
No.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
Your classmates?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Jeez! That's a great story,
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To pit your own life against another.
The moment of truth.
Oh sure.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Well, I didn't.
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
I've got to finish it.
I've come for my father!
And what about you?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
-- Hound of resurrection?
In private, if you don't mind...
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
That makes him more than a hundred --
I think that is its hand.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
He's just going through a phase --
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Did he, now?
Got tired of me?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
We're on the move.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
His what??!!
Yup.
Oh-n-no -- I --
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Cocky.
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
You did this before, right?
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
I don't remember.
Bastard.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
I don't want to see the dress.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
I don't.
Which is where?
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
I cut myself.
No, you're not.
Please...
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
I got through.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Is Julia here?
Surprise.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
I don't believe it.
No. It's all over.
Not that late.
Meaning what?
Oh no.
What happened to you?
I beg your pardon?
Play it.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
But now I kind of like it.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
What do you mean, "what?"
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
How do you know about that?
Fuck off, Barry.
Yes way.  It's really...
We're getting that anyway.
No.  We need the gig.
Sonic Death Monkey.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
You can be and are wrong.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Right.  Why?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I want a tape.
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
And do you like it that way?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Mmm hmm.
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
What it was like.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
I know.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I don't know.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Hey.  It's Liz.
It's true!
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Enough of what?
I understand completely.
The Conformist.
Yeah.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Whatever.
What's the name of your label?
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
You're very macabre.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You've been listening to rumors.
You want me to front for you.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
He is older than I.
I haven't killed _you_.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
You and I should talk first.
All fashionably without heads.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What were you doing in Felton?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Aye.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Does it change with me in the room?
We are brothers.
You are still so very young.
This is madness!
No!
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Again.  Try again.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
Not likely.
Either you are with me or against me.
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
Kahn?
Head still secure to the neck.
It's good to see you, Kahn.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
He always did.
You're wrong.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
What are you getting at?
Home.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
Hello, Bensinger.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
What?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
No -- she didn't.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
You'll ask me to what?
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
Hello, Hildy!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
You can break it, can't you?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You -- you --
Keep away --
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Bermuda.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Say, could I meet him?
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
You said it.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Railroad tickets.
Finished!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
What's that -- what's that?
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
Point the gun at me!
Three sixes. Is that any good?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
What do I know about Williams?
What?
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
What is it?
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
My name is Louis Peluso.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Sure I do, Earl.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
You can't bribe me!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
Who told you that?
I only know one.
Sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Well, for the baby, really.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
I will if you will!
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Out.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Father, that's enough now
Really, that's a long time.
Yikes.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Who's your Daddy!
He left!
Whoopie fucking doo.
Wondering what?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
You mean John Wayne?
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Tasted pretty good.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Drive through it!
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
I don't want to see that.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Maybe he's a cyborg.
I can't believe...
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Not yet.
That's the understatement of the year.
Huh?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
I was just kidding.
Great.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Call Wydell.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Gabrielle.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
That would be good.
Hmmmph.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Urgh.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
But I like being human now.
My brother is discreet.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Oh, Rosie.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
He looks perfectly fine.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Good. Making progress.
It would just be helpful to know.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Absolutely!
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yes.
Tomorrow, the acid test.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
here, here.
You look different... More relaxed.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
That's right, Miss Packard.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
You ever played billiards before?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Twelve thousand.
Poker's not your game.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Whaddya been so far?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Thinking about what?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
Come on, let's go...
Over there by the bar.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
Half.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Why?
In the gut, I mean.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Oh yeah? Where?
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Is that what you think?
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Ten dollars.
Fair.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I could always get us a bottle.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Give me a drag.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Me. It's Eddie.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
Well, what else does?
I love you.
A week? A year?
Oh, grow up.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That is not now, human!
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Stay alive.
Yes.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
I guess you could say that.
Do we have to?
Is the hill ours too?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Sure ... fine.
What, Jim, what?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Why?
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
What? -- I... 
I have school.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Not really...
Can't this thing go any faster?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
She didn't take my name when we were married.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Better than we thought.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
But what, General?
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
Yes.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
Where?
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
We're through!
I usually don't either.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
No?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Through the library?
Well, what was left of him.
The floor's on fire! See?!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
After you, Junior.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
You think so?
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Dr. Jones? The eminent archaeologist?
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
Yes, I understand.
Nee chin lie how ma?
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Yeah, that's what happened...
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight!
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Can you move your arm?
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
Keep stroking it!
Maybe...
Just try and control yourself.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Don't catch cold.
What -- the bug?
No... the heart's still beating!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
Yes, they believe you.
Yes?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Yeah?
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
Kill myself.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
We have to get out of here.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Black suits and helmets.
That's not a good idea.
We'll change your appearance.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Just get there.
I don't want to eat it.
No...you idiot!
Rene...
Not blue enough.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
You have no taste.
It lends you an air of mystery.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
What is it?
You get time off to sleep.
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
Osaka.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
That's not funny.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Neither can they.
While he makes the run.
And Dieter?
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
I have been... I think you're right.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
Oh no!
They can?
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Newer, more powerful design.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Yes. Joe.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
Here?
Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Not...complaining, actually.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Let you leave without it.
Like there's someone else here.
I am sort of scattered.
Are you alright?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Were you working for him last night?
We're very close.
One chip?
Hiroshima.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Then where's the chip.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Sure I can, can't I?
What'd...you forget?
Why did you, then?
For you.
Escape.
You're gonna laugh.
Her?
Why'd you invite me here?
What about the others.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
The other working.
Perfectly.
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
What's new?
Instant rice...?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Yeah.
We gotta hook up.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
Alright, alright.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Maybe later.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
You're exaggerating!
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Catch ya' later.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
How are you, Jim?
Yeah?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Who's calling?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
What?!
Jeffrey...
...you fucked me!
I'll call you then.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
No shit.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, please, Mike...
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
It's okay.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Object to the form!
Howard!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
What part?
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Is she Asian?
You have the pre-nup?
No. I haven't. Have you?
What is it you're after, Miles?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Absolutely.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Okay Miles.
Me. Yes.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I bet.
May I come in?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
What kind of "stuff?"
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
You can't prove anything.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
No buts. Now. Out.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
She did a Harriman.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
When you have a moment.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Video.
Berry spoons.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
What...?
She owes me a meal.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
-- the coin?
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
Yes, I know—but—
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Yes. Peter Warne.
I'm sorry you read it.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
All right, let it go.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Huh?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh—the papers—
Yeah?
What am I going to do now?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's none of your business.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Santa Claus?
King—King Westley was in it.
What are you talking about?
Well, you were!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Why, haven't you—?
This isn't "piggy-back."
know—but—
But what!
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Hay—in my teeth.
You're an expert, I suppose.
You! Don't make me laugh.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
We don't need forty cars.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Same to you.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Won't I ever see you again?
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
What time is it?
What's 'at?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Collect?
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Oh!!
Yeah, you'll have to git .
What's the idea?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Not one word.  That's an order.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
There were no phone records.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Keep saying what?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What did they...
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
What?
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Well... yeah.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
And how tall are you?
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
How'd you know where he was?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
Sure.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Can you do it or not?
But you're not going to stop her?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
What did they want to know?
It was the other guy who busted me.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
He came by.
You're not old. You look great.
Bigger?
"American President"
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Why?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
You do that?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
What's he doing?
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Are you scared of me?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
A Broadway shopping bag.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Who's the other one?
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it.  And someone killed her for it.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Kinda.
Got some o.j.?
Sure.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Uh-huh.
Who?
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
What does she think she's gettin?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
How long?
Four years?
It's a diet thing?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
We had done time together already.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
And your point is?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Lemme have the bag.
Who's your partner?
That's good money.
Then what?
An employee I had to let go.
So what, you left her there.
Where did you shoot her?
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
She got off, huh?
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
In a way, yes.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
I was gonna tell you...
No problem.
He leave town?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
No, thanks.
Well, how do I look?
Hello, Sam.
Hey, you're talkin' about Paul. Who'd want to hurt him?
Yeah, ever since that ...
Oh God!
I could have told you that.
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
It was the window.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Why do you say that?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
He told me he was going to Hell.
Shit!
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I don't know what to say.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
It's freezing.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I moved the couch. That's all.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Did you look around the headboard?
Your kid dropped it off.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
Lemme see.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
I just want to look ...
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
Why do you bring her up?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off!
Coming here?
That's your decision.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
Remember that.
What's he talking about?
Who else were you expecting?
Let go!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
West.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down!
Where have they gone?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Long time ago.
Shows how much you knew.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Just relax.
What's happening? Help me.
I no from around here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
They're awfully heavy.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
What is wrong with you?
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Get out of here!
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
He came for me, I had to run!
Cool.
The hull's imploding!
And now we're all out of it.
I am an expert!
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Not a chance.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
You just keep an eye out.
But I didn't see...
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
I hope so.
Eat me.
You'll be fine.
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
I'm on my way.
Shut up, Thorgan!
GO, GO, GO!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Let's just get out of here.
You prefer an apple?
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
No! He's coming with us!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
More soldiers?
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
No!
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Thank you.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Why?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What? What?!
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Why don't we just tow it in?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I can't imagine why.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Some friends and me took a house.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
That wasn't funny.
Twenty years.
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Is that a boat?
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
I don't have it.
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
I'm supposed to be running.
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Why?
Mine too.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Did you hear it's yours?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
You don't know anything about me!
Oh, go fly a kite.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
I rock a Harmony.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
You weren't even alive!
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Junk?
I know what junk is.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
You don't have to do that.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
That suits you.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
You do?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
What's the matter?
Really? Fingernails?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Nothing...
Then what's going on?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
There are ads? For parents?
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
What?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Keith's hot.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Hm.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Like what? Be a rock star?
Yeah, downtown.
...Yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Could I try that?
Adele... are you serious?
Almost.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
As many times as it takes.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Turkey mostly.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Best kind.
Forget it.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Now why is that?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Yeah.
Nah... how much money have you got?
If you say so.
Thank god!
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
Carrie.
I don't want to talk about it.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
Who are you?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Oh shit. How long did it take?
How?
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What do you want?
Den less go Joe.
Right.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I give pennies?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Yeah probably.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah me too.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Hold on.
Yeah.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
How do you know?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Why?
Because your a virgin?
What?
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
No.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Thanks.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Hell yeah, they don't know.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
But then I won't need your money.
Yep.
Yeah.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
You are!  I don't like you.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
What's the first street?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
I haven't got time for this.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Where is she?
Please... wait.
The game's over.  You lost.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
Fuck off!
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He already did once.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Uh huh.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Okay.
How long has she been dead?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What do you think he did?
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
Through a rental agency.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
A building?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Are we going to go through this again?
I went out.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
He knows you're aware of that.
You're always in the middle of a match.
I want to be the best I can.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
No you didn't.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Doesn't that scare you?
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Alright.  What about me?
What is this?
Call room service.
You.
Then why are you backing up?
You really haven't seen my best side.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
I'm not nervous.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Yes.
Let us wish him peace.
She can see the Beast!
You have done it?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
I cannot betray my bride.
Yes, my lord.
I am Quell.
You can have half.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
You had better manners as a pig.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
Then he will die!
A match for your son, I think.
Yes. We lost five.
The new King.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
She has the power to kill.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
I was beautiful then.
She bore you many children?
You had a son.
Why must you know?
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
What, for example?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
Too heavy.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Nothing, for the moment.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Can it kill me?
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Twenty miles?  I see.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Please tell me.
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
That's okay -- really it is.
Where?
Good.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I see.
That's a reasonable assumption.
Red flag, man.
This guy's not a murderer.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Why know?
What Mr. Parker?
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Me neither.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Right... OK...
No?
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
I have a 4.0.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Who could better understand than me?
No.
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Was she carrying a weapon?
What'd you do?
Josh proposed!
Did she do that to you, too?
Neat.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Are you asking me on a date?
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Why not?
I don't know --
Of course, I do!
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
That's why I think it's time for us to --
That's not entirely --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
You go where?
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
It's not a Theta --
You're right. Phew!
Pull up next to him!
Then we smash 'em?
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Do it now!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Careful, lad.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll find it.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
There must be some way to get it up there.
Sunlight, you say?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
He'll not escape me.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
No, no, no... this is different!
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
But you did... you did!
I detest serpents.
I'll go search for it.
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Who?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Its powers are strong.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Not very precise directions.
Ask away, sweet man.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Only that?
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
We wait.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
You follow.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
What are you doing?
He was there and then he wasn't!
Sam!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Oh.
Here, honey!
He seems lonely.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
You look better without make-up.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Okay.  I guess.
You'd hate him for the trick.
He's at work while I'm here.
He's not the type to worry.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Well, if it is, we have a problem.
How's your wife?
He buys and sells the world.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I'm not.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I don't know.
It bugs me.
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You're so predictable.
I don't know.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
Try it.  It feels good.
Hi, Mom.
I'm telling you now.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I still don't know what that means.
Left you this place.
I know there's an explanation.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
I was parked in day parking.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I drove over and you were gone.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
Sam's favorite.
Do you remember?
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Not a perfect day.
The payoff.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'd be you.
We should take a vacation.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Why not?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You need collateral.
I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Still got that ten dollars?
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
Does that mean I'm in?
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
You drew this?!
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Crawfords.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
It'll be too late.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
Understood.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
You mother...
Noon...
Sure, why not?
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
My mom wasn't a goat?
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Son, just do your best.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Coulda been much worse.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
No.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
So I followed him...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Are you dead?
Why would you be floating?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
I love you.
If it's Cassius, yes.
See something you like, my man?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Up there.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Just the face.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I changed my mind.
About what?
I'm not armed.  Well?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
You know something.
About running, dying what?
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
How can I?
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
Of course --
Some people say children need human mothering.
Let's see -- how long has it been?
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
He's good, isn't he?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
What is?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
What's that, Ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Yeah.
Yeah. Call him.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Yes, I believe so.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tone deaf.
The first night... Not the last two.
I can't give you anymore. I'll talk to the doctor.
That's absurd.
I like to laugh, Fred.
When you didn't come to the club.
I wish I knew.
What?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
No... of course not.
Which would you choose?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
At sixty?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
You're my man, Pete.
What?
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
Okay.
What night?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
Fossils, huh?
A what?
Oh, I see.
Not at all.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Have I?
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Sounds like a stall to me.
Horns? What kind of horns?
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Think of it! In times like these.
Huh?
You mean you don't want to go?
We follow many.
That's intelligent.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Centuries.
Well, is it?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
How can we get in touch with them?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
I don't know.
That's what's on the other side of the hill.
Shhh!
Let me go, Bob!
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
What about the others?
I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
In for what?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
Struggling, why?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Kay...
What?  Who the hell are you?
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
There's a god damn good reason.
Where to?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
What the hell does that mean?
They respond to fear, right?
Maybe you need a closer look.
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
What if I don't?
They went right to the President.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
Forget that guy --
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Anderton --
Someplace safe.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
You set your patients on fire!
-- go blind.  I know.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
But you call this room the "temple".
Just a nickname.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Tell me how.
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
I forgive you.
He's alive?
The precogs were wrong.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
I'm... not... a... killer.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
I thought you were retiring?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Lamar --
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
No.  He can't...
I don't know, why?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Yeah.
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
What if I gave you forty?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
No.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
No more.
He's not doing it.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
I don't know.
No.
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Who's watching the baby?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I'll support you.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Get your hands off of her.
So, when's the drop.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Shit.
What's that?
No.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Pshhh...
What?
I don't understand.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
Where's the drop?
Bobby.
Soho.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
What about boxing?
So, it was a draw.
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I like it.
I like it.
Seat belt.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Nah, don't bother --
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
C'mon, man...
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
Nothing.
They asked who it was.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Yeah. What vibe?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You fucking nuts?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
C'mon, man...
The what?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
It was six in the fucking morning.
You're out of money?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Easy...
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Where do you live?
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Thanks.
You rode?
What?
Tell me.
Goodbye.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
Bet you like that shit.
Yes, sir.
When?
You never had it.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
Man, what do you want?
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Okay, okay.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Where am I gonna start?
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
She ate.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
How do you like it?
Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Just hold me.
You're with me even when you're away.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
What do you want me to do?
Dear heart, where are you?
Let's get out of this cold.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
That's right.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Yes, sir, I did.
Say what you're saying.
And like a fool I believe it.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
'Bout every other night, Red.
If she got eyes, she do.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
I mean it's late, baby.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
Please make way, please --
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
...That isn't a whore?
You better believe it.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
So you are going to talk me to death.
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
[No!]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Who's he?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
Have you used this type before?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Maybe...
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
I know. But which state?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
My ankle.
You need to practice.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Then be trained.
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
I'm fine.
Then don't come.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
She understands men.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
What? Who?
He has to go.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[I should start going for your tits first.]
So am I.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Who told you that?
What happen?
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Your son Marty?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Yes, I know.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Marty...
Nothing.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hiya, Ralph...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Well...
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
Well...
I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
You talked to Walt?
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
How you, Radar?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
No.  Or why you should.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Wisconsin.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
What's that?
Call Dago Red.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
That's right. We work well together.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Of course not.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Thanks.
There's only one worth noticing.
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
That. It's out of the act.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Oh, get out of here!
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yes!
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Uh-huh . . .
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
So?
Duets? But can we trust him?
Oh!
Awwwww!
I ain't seen him for a week.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Naw.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
Sure, you are.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
John Doe Club?
How?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Uh-huh.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
How?
What happened, Mike.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
They want Walter dead!
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
How can I help you with the particles?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Johnny who?
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
Recruited you from where?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
What's the first commandment?
I do.
Fine.
Damnit!
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Ronnie...
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I can't do that.
Come on!
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
It's all been transferred.
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
Yes.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
What about the customers with reservations?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
What?
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
No.
Corporation can.
Realize?
But you were with me.
There was no other choice.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
Try me.
Resurrection.
Male.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Now tell me... what do you see?
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
WHITE TIGER!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
What's a Triac?
I think so.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Quack like a'duck!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
But not you.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
You scare me, Charlie.
Life knocked me back.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
You got something to hide?
It always is.
But there's...
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Couple hands. No harm in it.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
We can operate around these guys.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Luciano is dead?
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Uhh - martini?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I am not. And I don't gotta.
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
Isn't that Lulu?
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
We like to think so, yeah.
... What are they all doing there?
Mother!
He seemed quite taken with you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
... Manly?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
It was?
It couldn't be.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Drunks are funny--
Shut up, Diz.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Any time.
Tunnel?
Okay--I mean--
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Great saints!
Taylor, my dear.
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Yes, Jim.
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Oh, a *boy*!
Than what?
Emma!
Certainly. Step right in.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Yes, I was--
Ah, now, that's better.
Will he *yield*?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Jefferson--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
How's Amos, Ma?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
You *couldn't*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Tonight.
Good. Where are we?
The Steering Committee.
He did?
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Terrible, thank you.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Second drawer.
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Wonderful!
Splendid.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
I know that.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
No?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Nice *compliment*!
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Jim, you don't have to--
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
But--if he *does*, Joe--
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Certainly.
Yes, I—
Yes.
NO!!
And you saw them happen?
What's that got to do with it?
You are , aren't you?
Tell me more about yourself.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
What did they say?
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
It had better be good.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
All right.
A girl?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
You're acting like a school girl.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Last night he proposed to me.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
That's the rub.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
You can't?
What?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Who - me? No.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb—
No, thanks.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Are those stories true?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Thank you, Your Honor.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota - north?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Uh-huh. What are they?
What happened?
Could you come with me please?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
I'm fine.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Why not?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
I didn't hear you.
Do you want to come in?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Oh?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
My patient had to leave early.
Who was that?
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Oh, I don't know...
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Got a license?  But no car?
Don't need it.
You're good.
Got to.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mumford... like the town?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Hmm.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
I've offended you!
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Yes.
Disgusting.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
And this is legitimate therapy?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
What was that?
Which show was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you think about it?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Where was this?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What happened today?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
He agreed?
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I understand.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Don't you like this?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
I can tell you anything else.
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Psych major?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
You're not going to kill us?
Why do you like to fight so much?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
What does he want the book for?
Perhaps.
And what did he say?
Proceed!
Every damn day.
I found sand. I saw death.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
What are those mirrors for?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
That bad huh?
I'm staying.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Awfully.
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!
And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
What --?
Your mind is so slippery.
One last tweak.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
And some sandwiches --
The Inscrutable Six?
You're dead.
Really?
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Then why are you here?
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Sure.
Why?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Who wouldn't?
That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
When are you going to take off that mask?
He is in love. His anger is gone.
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
How could I see him if he's invisible?
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
No.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
I use it... to fight evil.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Be a Mohican. 
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Please...
Things are quite serious, I should say.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Where are they?
Properly arranged, yes.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Come in.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Have you been back recently?
Ah-hh, no.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I'll have the fire built up.
No...
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
No.
Promise me.
You are my old friend.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Why did you give it to him?
There are some things... better left unsaid.
I wrote it.
What?
I couldn't face telling you.
How do you know?
Yes?
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
Well, let me in.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Yup.
What about the dog?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
I can't taste nothing.
You walked?
How you know?  It could be anything.
What's the B-G's?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
And some rolling papers.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
I don't know.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
I can't feel my legs no more.
I'll take you later.
Nothing.  What you want?
Yeah, and hurry up.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
What happened here?
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
For what?
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
What?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Good.
Yes, I'm listening.
How should I...?
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
Nods.
Over and out.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Is within himself.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
I remember. The big tipper.
Kill the Governor.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
Fuck you!
It goes in that little hole.
You have, huh?
Shut up.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Only you.
You're wasting time.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
She went.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
About what!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Sshhh! He's in there.
What!
John! Don't!
You what?
She's gone to Moundsville.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Huh?
What's taking you so long about it?
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Come to me, boy!
Yes?
Because John said I mustn't.
O' course.
How's that?
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
When did I ever?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
Okay, okay.  I think.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
What happens if they don't do that?
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
He's dangerous.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Warm milk. Gross.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Right.
Nancy?
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
You should. I'll show you.
Evening gown?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
That's another thing... it's spring.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Shall we tell her?
Oh, yes, yes.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
It is Thursday!
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Razinin.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
A day.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
What business?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're going to force us... huh?
On what?
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
Me?
How long do we have to wait here?
What?
No.
You might hold this for me.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
So that is your house?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Then do it through my lawyer!
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Will you smile?
I wish they had never met.
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
I promise... I swear.
You must, darling.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No speech?
Our salute will be a kiss.
All right.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
We have nothing to discuss.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
I must insist that you leave.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Why?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is that?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
You did say it, sir.
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
I'll bet he would.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Why not?
Cox!  Fire him.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
That's right ...
I don't know anything about that.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
I did?
Silence!
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
You never told him?
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Sir?
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
Is it my turn?
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I know ...
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
I beg your pardon --
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
Yeah ...
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
You're shittin' me.
Ernie Davis.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Proud?
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
I'll concede in the morning.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Is that the truth?
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
They're all your enemies?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
In Angola. Yeah.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Not word one.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
Lord no. I'm not retired.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Just keep it up.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
What're you goin' to do?
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Uh-huh.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
You know what's goin' on?
She'll be all right.
I know something better.
Step out of the car please, sir.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Why would I care where you're going.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With what?
Now. We close now.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
How's that?
Well enough.
That's not an answer.
The option.
You want to change rooms?
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
What else then?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I don't mean braze.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
No. You don't.
I don't know.
No sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Could I have that in American?
...I meant your food.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Junior year!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What about it?
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
Do you know why I'm here?
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I'm sorry.
This is really awkward...
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
All the time...
We were engaged.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I know. It's up to us.
Didn't I?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
Thanks...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I got you, Del...
...well, then you ain't got much.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
It's not really a good time, guys...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Did you love it?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
No. Loma Vista.
I'll go to the Hospital.
You're hurting him!!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
The Five?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
I was talking about what you could wear!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Fine.
Where are you going?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
No...
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
That is so right.
IT SURE IS!!
He told us it's in the Buick.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm not telling.
What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Wesley...
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
Betty was a lovely child.
What do you mean?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
He's waiting...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
What the hell's going on?
No! Let me try this!
I SAID FORGET IT!
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
You can't do this -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
Gopher, Everett?
Okay, Everett.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Oh, okay.
In any state.
Suckin' away.
- in the gods - Huh?
You -
Aw, that's all right.
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
Thank you, sir!
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
When did this happen?
No, sir!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Or we could do that yeah.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
How late?
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Great.
Yeah... Mmmm...
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Seriously.
Not me.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Forget it. Just get out of here.
You're better than candy.
I've never had a girl.
I don't want you to move.
Are those for me?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I bet you do!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
He said he grew up poor?
I've seen better.
But it can't wait.
Do you know that for sure?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
You know how this gotta end.
NOT THAT ONE?!
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Shut up.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're gonna die in there!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Jesus, what was I thinking?
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
Not at all.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
No fucking way.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
What's to keep them from prying open the door?
Well, I know that now.
What do they want?
Give me a break.
YOU HAVE TO!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
"Titanic."
I saw something, I saw...
Blue is phones?
On it!
He won't even know who it was.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Okay.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah, I do, but he's gotta cool it...
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the fucking car.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
Naw... I gotta...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Good.
Pride will do.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Do you?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Is that so?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
How old are you?
God help us all when you're forty.
No, I don't.
I stand corrected.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'm sorry.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Thank you.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Put them away.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You're telling me.
You keep saying that.
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I'm thinking about going to bed.
Shit! Look at this mess!
And because the dead walked.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
We got that part.  Anything else?
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
All right then.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I know where your heart truly lies.
Ceremony?
About the day we met. Do you remember?
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
It doesn't!
Me!
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We'll see about that.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Agreed!
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Depends.
On what?
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
No, thank you.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Nebbleman.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Thank you, sir.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Aaabout...?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Well, you got another problem.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Right.  You predicted it.
It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
Daniel!
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Got it.
The waste.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Probably the caffeine.
Do you have something to bring me down?
No problem.
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
Something else I want to try.
That's going to fit me?
The head shrinker at the prison.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I have to!
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
You were looking for us?
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
The question is, are you?
We lost him.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
You may go, Smythe.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
I'm glad.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Now let's get this settled—
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Yes - isn't it?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Stewart!
You can't walk out of here like this.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
Is that so?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
It's the smoke.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Nothing.
Staring at us?
Been where?
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Sorry, boss—
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She did—?
I beg your pardon.
Okay - you remember Joe—
It's all right. Bring him in.
I have. Double-strength!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Now the lady said you may go—
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Yes, sir.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Okay.
What?
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
I'm fine.
Hello Bill.
No ...
All night?
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Where are you gonna go?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
What?
... Lover's Lane.
"Changes."
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Okay--that's enough!
Well, I never had to do it before.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
What happened?
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
What were you doing in a library?
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
It's okay.
Not directly anyhow ...
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
What?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Oh ... Right.
What's that like?
I'm not sure.
Marmalade.
... Like Prince Charming.
Ooomph?
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
EXCUSE ME?
Just gimme the damn remote!
I understand.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
I brought you something ... From the library.
Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
This is "Fly With Us?"
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Why?
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Why?
I feel really on the spot now.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
No.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
Really?
It doesn't matter.
No.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
....what....?
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
-- you said you did.
I have to go.
I don't know.
Not very well.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Alright?
About six months.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Yes.
Did you pick it up from the street?
I don't know.
Hi.
Have a good trip.
Lena?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
Yeah......yeah.....
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
This is funny.
This is nice.
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
Let's go to the hospital.
I'm sorry.
Ok.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
No.
Well who did?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
And your name?
What's that for?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
....I have seven.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
You have another house somewhere or something?
No.
I know.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
When can you leave?
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
Then what's he doing here?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Enough to discern its tenor.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Then it must've been love --
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
It's a formality; truly.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
Of course.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Don't start --
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
I don't believe it!
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Forgive me, I beg you --
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
He needs me here.
And he did.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
One . . . buys things.
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
You needn't use that language with me
You are repellant when you drink.
Sir? 
Please be quiet.
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Right-
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The old man has his own way of doing things
Jesus
Oh Christ
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Listen to me-
I don't have it anymore?!
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
How?
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Craig is one syllable
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I don't give a shit about-
This ain't George's doing--!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
George...
Thank you-
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Again
They've all seen a rough cut
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It's just that my movie is so-
I really think you're
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Happy birthday.
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
I know what you want but it can't be done!
We done?
We're from...
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
Hit me in the face.
You heard me, I said hit me.
Go ahead.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
You wasn't with her?
With her? How?
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Except fall down like a normal person.
Well, that's what I mean.
So what?
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Nine o'clock.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
What does that mean?
It's OK.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Why don't you just call him?
I dunno.
C'mon, Tommy --
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Jeff -- huh?
Ever get an answer?
You sure it belongs to his wife?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like an old hambone?
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Jeff --
No.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
He and his wife splitting up?
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Isn't he a salesman?
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
There's probably one in the basement.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Yes.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Tired?
I think it's enchanting.
Lisa! Shut up!
Of course not.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Without any future?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Now, Lisa --
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
125 West Ninth Street.
Someone not his wife?
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
Is he cleaning house?
Two minutes.
Friend of yours?
Chicken?
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Will you wait a minute?
I don't want to learn that!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Just relax, please relax!
Are you going down there?
Look--just relax, will you?
Open it.
Stay here.  That was my son!
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What's a chickie-run?
No.  It's okay.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
Help me in!
Your father!
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Good Lord!
Do I have to spell it out?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
If he could--
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Bully for you.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
It doesn't matter to them.
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
I'm getting that way, too.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
There's just one thing.  What about--
We have to go back!
No!  I got to find him.
Okay.
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
What?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
-- till he fucked his parole --
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
No, no --
One more. Smile. One more.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yes it was all you --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
You sold him out.
JESUS CHRIST!
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
...maybe I die for Nick...
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
You saved me.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Well. I'm going home.
You said it a million times!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Yes!
What?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Bam Bam.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
...never... tried...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
No way.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
What?
My what?!
Hi, Nick.
How do we take them out?
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
What?
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
How'd you know I'd do it.
You gave them me.
But... I had a five...
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
How do you know all this?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Did the two of you talk?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Dead as Dillinger.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't believe in it.
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
No, I'm not!
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
You really think we were set up?
Uh-uh, just cops.
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Nobody. The light was bad.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
Why do you think?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
All right -- it's said!
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Why?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
You'll live.
Don't act so -- crazy.
That's a good girl.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
I like it.
And you're all alone.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
I don't like to see you go.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
No. We're not stayin' --
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
And you've got me all figured out?
If you need me, I'll be --
I think he wants me.
Alex, what are you doing?
That's it.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
So, I guess I can go now.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Shhh!
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I think so.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Yes!!!!
Alright, let's take a vote...
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Uh, uh.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Just a little Rogaine.
Alright, go to the belt store...
How is she?
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
She sure can pick 'em!
Thanks, Mom.
Oh Mom...
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Shhhh..
Oooohhhh.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
I beg your pardon?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes... but... I didn't...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
You can't tell.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Which room is it?
No.
You could go and open the door.
No.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
How much have you got?
What circumstances?
Redi's all right.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I ought to know.
What is it?
And that was all?
What did she want to know?
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
Yes.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
No!
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I can imagine.
And you believe that?
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -— you're off to work.
After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
But you would like to know where she is?
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
No. She's no longer under my care.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
I didn't know.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
We haven't even begun tea yet.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
No, I think you look... fine.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Okay, I will!!
Kids? What about them?
Do you want me to?
You are?
What?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Basically, yes.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Yes.
I'm sorry this came up.
How did you know?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Don't you want to make one?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Can't or won't?
You said you weren't always impotent.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Don't you get lonely?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Why not?
No.
Not entirely.
No.
Why don't I believe you?
Loud.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
You bitch. I knew it.
No, I didn't.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What visitor?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Well, what, then?
Then why'd you call me?
Questions about sex.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
I feel like I do.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
What is it?
It does not.
Okay.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
There's a phone here.
You want me to leave?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Why don't you let me tape you?
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Were you disappointed?
Do you think I'm pretty?
No? Not even one more?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Cynthia. John.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
What do you mean?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Who?
You were prying before?
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
One moment.
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Do I get a kiss?
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Gonna cut me open?
I don't get it.
OK. I'll think about it.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Time to check with Flavors.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Why Janet?
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
I'd forgotten.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
That doesn't make sense.
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
YOUNG BLOOD
YOUNG BLOOD
YOU'RE NO GOOD
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Say, is Maya working?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
I can't help the traffic.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
I'm working on it.
And get your bone smooched.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
You know that chick?
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
What do you think?
I'm a quick learner.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Okay! Fuck!
I'm fine!
Shut up. Shut your face.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Okay! Jesus!
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Nope.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Shut up.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
I know what you need.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Quite a week.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, same here.
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I had class.
Okay.
I'm sure he believed every word.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
French or American?
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
You golf?
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
No.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
You want him coming in the house next time?
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Me too.
I have some upstairs.
It's old Morgan.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
What's that?
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
Why not?
It's like War of the Worlds.
Don't worry.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
That's why I'm here.
It's one thing to know it...
That I do.
You're not Baxter?
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I expect.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
It's not going to be easy.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Because they don't like what I want.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Let's get out of here.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
You can't do this.
That ain't right.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
Rae, I need help.
What makes you think I could?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
I just got to town.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
It is that.
What's she got to do with it?
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon?
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Of course.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Excuse us.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
If it's on the page...
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Better late than never.
That's true.
She said you were very beautiful.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Not quite.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Hello, is this Elaine?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
You look so, so...
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
How about the nudity?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Hello, Hal.
Clyde.
Body double.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
Somebody said she was here.
You want me to call Security?
Don't be.  It was worth it.
Not like this --
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
She still with Kent?
I read.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I know what you're up to.
The background is.
We used to.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
The only real truth is in the work.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
--Do I know you?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
Look over there.
I forgot myself.
Yes.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
I don't know, Cole.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You do?
Really?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Yeah.
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Meaning?
What are you talking about?
See?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Someone actually... employs you?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Sorry.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Manure... is life.
Hi Suze.
Harvest moonshining!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Starla, it ain't --
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
It's just a work thing.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Margaret.
You know how rumors start.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Uh-oh.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
That man is your father?!?
How'd you know?
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
Why are we doing this?
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
Not for long, you ain't.
Do I have a choice?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
Bandit?
Now what?
You okay?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Go breaker.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
And a very bad gamble.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Pretty much, yep.
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
I said I got his machine.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
Look at the collar on that coat...
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...He does now...
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
I don't see it like that at all.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
I'm here.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah, I can front this.
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
A Fed? Like FBI?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Security's locking down the elevators.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Yes.
He's dead.
What?
He'll let me in.
How long can you go without sleep?
Shut up.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
And professionally?
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
I won't be making the trip.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
I'll go with you.
To calm your anxiety.
I want you inside me right now.
Book?
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
If you're here.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
But then I would be dead now.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
What's to like?
What do you want?
Claire, will you calm down?
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Do you dance?
I know.
"To"... Forget about you.
Mike...?
You take care.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Claire...
I'm all right.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Where'd you get the tie?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
She bought it.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I watched TV.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
No.
Me neither.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Even Joey Venza?!
It should've been me...
You in this with me?
Be happy.  He's good at this.
No, sir...
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I'll prove it!
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Why should she come in?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
Remember Little League?
No, no.
See?
Or was it all a dream?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
I know.  I've got one too.
I got you a present.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Can we make it a hundred?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I'm sure you kept warm.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Why?
Aunt May, what happened?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Right.  Let's go.
No, no!  Not there!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
You make my mouth water.
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
It is.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
And this?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
No?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Says me.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What guy?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Russian women prisoners?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Really? What do you feel?
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
On screen.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Yes, where would you go?
It's our pleasure.
Oh, of course.
I hadn't planned on it.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
Make it so.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Aye, sir.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
It's a little early to celebrate.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
I have already made one transmission too many...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
Do you have an explanation?
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Just him, sir!
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
. He will remain always as he is.
Why would you do this...?
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
No.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
... Or the one.
... Spock...
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
What I have done, I had to do.
I only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  There are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.

Sir, may I --
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Thank you.
Ah.
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
... Can't read you... repeat...
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
What's the matter -- ?
Never mind! Hurry!
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
It was just words.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
It's not much different from Enterprise.  When I was a guest aboard her some years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review: You say you have no details of Project 'Genesis' ?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Aye, sir --
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Give the word, Admiral.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Aye...
To be sure, Captain.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Uhura, patch me in --
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
And why not?
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Energize defense fields.
Stage Two of what?
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
At what.
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
Understood, sir.
Visual.
Trying, sir!
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
I do this because I was there,
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
What do you think, Spock?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
... Best shot...?
Can you isolate the wave?
Go ahead. Stun me.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
I suppose they told you that...?
Why's that?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Iowa.
Or believe, I'll bet.
It's his way.
Just lucky, I guess.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
But you said toxic.
Yes.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Weapons systems?
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Everyone remember where we parked.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
No power to the bay doors.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
I notice you're still working with polymers.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
The keyboard... How quaint.
Tell her I feel fine...
Sulu Hikaru.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
There are caves in those mountains.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For what purpose?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
The artificial lifeform was right?
How about a passive radiation scan?
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Why not?
How long 'til they reach us?
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
I believe so.
Do it.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Understood. Keep me informed.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
Always am.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
You don't sound French.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Not yet.
The invasion plans.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
We?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Aye, sir.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Yes, sir.
Agreed. Options?
Where the hell are they going?
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Fascinating...
I wish I knew. Uhura?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Then let me help!
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
How can I trust --
Take them away.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Shields up. Battle stations.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
And your coat.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Anything else you want to tell me?
You hear that?
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Where?
From Enterprise?
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
I SHOULD have been -
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
WE SURRENDER.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
An error.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
This one can.
Why?
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No. I must deactivate you.
How long is that?
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
To new worlds...
Negative.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
Make it so.
This isn't about me anymore.
No!
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Do you have life support?
Understood.
What do we know about the planet?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
We’ve got him!
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
On screen.
Aye, sir.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
She's a predator.
And the Romulans invade.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
Yes.
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels.
I know.
What happened?
No race should be a slave to another.
I know.
You're not Reman.
I won't defend my life to you.
Not so long.
On my way.
We're being hailed.
Do as I tell you!
A matter of hours now.
What?!
And?
They will obey, Praetor.
Now go. I have some personal business.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
I make maps.
No.
Where did you stop last?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
It's taken on a disguise.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Marc Shermin.
What.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
This car runs on gas.
You'll see.
Closed.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Shit... shit... what shit?
You. Mouth closed.
Yes.
I...
How will I do this one?...
The driver will...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
Yes.
Please stay.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes.
I am your friend.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
Yes. Sing some more.
You can have one.
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
No one's traveling in this weather.
You're damn right I am.
I want to gamble.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
Yes.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Goodbye.
In the cars, too?!
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
What's all this squid shit?
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
That's right.
Clips.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
W'sup, Max?
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
What do you mean?
Only way I could stand your ties.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
That's pretty much the way it happened.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Your existence.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
No it doesn't.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
No.  It didn't.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Take the tape to the cops.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Hi there.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Winona.
This is Agent Mackelway.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Then why do I still have a badge?
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Do you think he singled you out?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
Huh?, sir.
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
How long have you been downtown?
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
What's this country coming to?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Oh yeah, I forgot.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
What did you tell him?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Yeah, of course.
I've got to take a piss.
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
Yes.
Suspect Zero?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
You? You went by the book?
[Follow me.]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Ever since I've known you.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I'd say about two weeks.
You better pay the man.
Just like that?
You too?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
...then ask where you met her...
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
My pleasure.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
I would love to see you again sometime.
It's not going to well?
...The red piece of shit over there...
Lorraine?
...Six months.
Yeah?
Goodbye. I lov... 
You don't call.
There's the rub.
It's a gig.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
An eight.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Well, let's hit that party.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Well, you're doing so well...
They turned you down?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Mike?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Tonight, baby.
You're crazy.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Whu?
It doesn't matter...
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
You gotta do it.
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's go.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I just need some time...
It starts at eight...
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
She didn't see.
We're not messing with you...
A day.
No...
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Shut up, Sue...
...it is so on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
What percentages for my family?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
And with prison record.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
Good.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Yes.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Who is he?
You like spaghetti?
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
How do you do.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
Don't you want dinner first?
I'm busy.
Tell me!
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
I do renounce him.
Just be patient.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You just woke up!
Is that good?
I don't get it.
Did you speak to my father?
Say again?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Bird!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
And Rome.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
What?
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
What club?
He's downstairs.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Marge and I are getting married.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
It's Freddie. Let me in.
I guess.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
My fiancée.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
Where's Dickie?
And you, sir? Any better?
Shut up! Shut up!
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Oh Marge.
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Excuse me?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
What?
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
That's good, isn't it?
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
No key, huh?
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
Why lie?
Or Tom and Peter even.
And don't forget. I have the key.
I don't remember the exact date.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
What kind of people?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Well... mostly...
Keep it.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
More people watch it.
Just what?
Kidding around... you know, fun.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, why?
How long has he been there?
This I gotta see.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
No, why?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
One-Ball McCall?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
Stick up?
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
You can do it in my mouth.
Can I see you again?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Why?
You just gonna leave 'em?
Cops don't do nothin.
What do you mean?
Have you tried the telephone?
Yes I am.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
Also clean.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Sure.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
You know how I feel about what you do.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
I'm a field agent.
Tell me what you really do.
The cell, Mason.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
Damn...
Okay.  What's the second thing?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Me too.
I did?  Huh!
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Nothing.  
My what?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
What's that?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Yes?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Jesus.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Exactly.
Not at all.
No, I...
Oh.
That you got let go.
Yes.  Very.
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
No, not really.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
All right. 
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Cathy!
Mom, they're in a cage!
Well, I suppose...
I know.
Don't you like us?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
What's the matter with them?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
I wonder if you could help me.
Yep.
Where?
See them two big trees across there?
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
Where would I get a boat?
Okay.
The little girl's name.
Thank you.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
I mean. I want to...
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I wish I could be that way.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
No, of course not.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Are they moulting now?
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
How do you know Annie?
Oh, yes.
Yes, but...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
No.
I think it could be fun.
Like what?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
It was like that yesterday.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Well, all right, but...
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
These weren't a few birds.
Then let's go. Now!
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
But what makes a thought start?
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
I have other means of sustenance.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye.
Where are they?
The scar.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
I know her friends.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
So you're going to kill him?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
It's not what you think.
No.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Would you care to be more specific?
Professor Barnhardt.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Yes, I have!
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Well, sure, but--
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
You still haven't answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
Come on in.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
But how -- how long--?
I'm sorry.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
Time to activate Plan B.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
El Vampiro.
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
You know what?  You're absolutely right.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
This is Michael.
Who, Laddie?
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Oh, no, you won't.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Do I look that needy?
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
What?!  Did you know that!?
Did you want to talk to me?
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Now you and David...
No... no, everything's different now...
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Why not?
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
Even poor people have T.V.s
No.  Why?
Nanook...
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Maybe.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
Then we'll never make it.
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Well, get to it.
When was the last time you used it?
A day or so ago... I guess.
After all this mess then.
After all this mess.
How far's that?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
Get your gear on.
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
It's the generator I think!  No power.
MacReady...?
The journey is part of my work.
On the towers?
And everyone looks like us?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
What kind of stories?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
But there's nothing here.
But you escaped.
Yes.
I'm used to that.
Last night.
Yes...
The air... the power.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Alexander.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
We make them see what we wish.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
A man can change his history.
I just love mechanical things.
Why is it -- breaking up?
You know I can't.
Sorry... I was distracted.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Got here as soon as I could.
I need... to talk to you.
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Do you know you were humming?
What is it?
You're not from beyond the valley.
What makes you say that?
That machine --
More than 800,000 years.
I will...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Every night.
We share everything.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
Learning was important?
Mara...?
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Might I ask why?
New Yorkers.
Kalen...
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
Temporarily.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You killed him?
You sure you know where to find one?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
[Beat] Thank you.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Yeah.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
What?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
It's Sunday.
William, you're not making sense.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
I'm doing fine.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
No. I don't want it to.
You thought my father was crazy?
I'll die either way.
You have no idea what's going on.
2004.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
The Jacket.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Why?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
Sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
So you never knew your mother?
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
What?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Aw, God.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
You want to come on in?
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
That sounds nice.
I'm a robber.
What?
How?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
Who's your friend?
I always knew that.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Okay.
Peaches.
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Okay.  I will, too.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Which part?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
It's probably not a good idea.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
I heard that.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Yeah.
Let's get it over with.
You're right.
Whaddo we do?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Just ignore him.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Shoot the radio!
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Pass him!
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
What?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Well... at least now you know.
Never met him.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
What's that?
No, I mean
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
No.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Really?  Very, very?
So she hasn't changed?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Do what?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Same here.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
And you met Mary how?
Fucking sickening.
You were following us?
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
'That right? Good for you.
He's no Steve Young.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
Are you all right?
Just a minute.
Who's that?
And did everything -- ?
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hi, Ted.
I agree there should be more.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, come on...
Go!
You're Woogie?
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
You got what stuck?
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
Something your father would've come up with.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Don't get too attached.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Sioux Indian, right?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Tell him, Ray.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Cooch. You're my hero.
That's right.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
And get rid of the dog.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
She's your sister?
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
It's not real.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Not no more.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
What do you mean?
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
So they took care of Leo.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Ray. What's your 20?
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
I'm with someone.
How did you know this was my car?
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
You know. The finger.
No.
Too aggressive?
Evan... or Maverick.
What are you talking about?
What if he's not?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
What about the plane?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What?
Why?
You ever fly an F-14? 
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
You don't have to do this.
Do what, show you a good time?
What kind of games?
How does it go?
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Take something off.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Well?
Sir?
You.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
AND HE'S GUNNING.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
You go. I'm staying with it.
On what?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
Gotta keep track of the competition.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Just once, if they take your plane away.
I can't eject.
They should have warned you about that one.
Don't.
I didn't ruin her.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
You saved our lives. You did it!
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I called your house.
My wife's house.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
Or....
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Why not?
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
How'd you find me?
Fuck you.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
I am Quaid.
It's about goddamn time.
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
Forty-one A, Ernie.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
On his way.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
No, Harry, I'm already late...See you tomorrow.
I've got Quaid.
He shoulda killed Quaid back on Mars.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Let's do it.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Bullshit.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Blondes.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
In a minute.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
Its tires are flat...
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
God, what a stink!
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
I have to talk to your brother.
Sustained.
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
No. No...
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- Remember?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
We're taking the other case.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
You really think that's what happened?
...Are you sure we want that?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
What's Art Esparza?
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Neither.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
That's right.
Exactly what happened then?
You tell me, man.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
For control of the prison drug trade?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
NO! GOD, NO...
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
You killed Mike.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Yep, it sure is.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
No you couldn't.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Thanks.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
I think that's a good idea.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Well, why not?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Laura, I am your friend.
No.
How did the car get back here?
WE got it back, that's all.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
No... No...
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
Send me a kiss.
What? She asked about my father?
Let's go all the way.
Why? It does.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
Oh, Laura.
"Oh, Laura..."
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
No.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Bobby didn't give you this?
I can arrange that. I like that.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
As far as we know, nothing.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I... yes.
I...
I do. Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
No.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Nothing further, your Honor.
When she...
We went to Code Blue...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
There's nothing they can do to me.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
It's a common medical term.
Why?
...that's perfectly all right.
Why is that?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Laura.
What happened...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Is there going to be a later...?
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Stop pressuring me...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's locked?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I'm sure you do...
...fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
It's a long road that has no turning.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Don't touch anything.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I'm going to help her.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
What?
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
As I've said we had some more...
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
No.  I thought you had them.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
You get any sleep last night?
Chase, you'd better come home.
What?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home, that's right.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Really?
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
What are you talking about?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Me too.
I can take it.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Thank you.
What do you mean?
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
No, I can't.
What?
You're not a moron.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
What about you?
I know.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Why then.
I guess.
Yes.
Good.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
I couldn't.
All stop on the engine.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Close the door.  Sit down.
He killed the dolphin.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Yes sir.
What's that?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
And being sixteen.
What's that?
That's enough.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Trust me donut.  I know.
I figured it out.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
What?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
I understand.
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Ready for another?
Whattaya mean family?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
No shit?!?! You know him?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No sir...
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Come here.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
How's that?
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
What's that, peanut?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What's that?
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
We got through two states already.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Oh shit...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
No radio or TV...
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Uh-huh?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Just a place.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Course I am, mama.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
Yes.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Someone's gonna see us.
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
Thanks...
The candelabras were my Gran's.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
She's a transvestite.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Not Curtis.
Yes.
Just go around him.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
So what's the problem?
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
And your wife left you.
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Shoot.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
That's really it.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Like the lady herself.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
I had to. Didn't I?
But... ?
Blocked.
Hm.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
Amazing.
How can you tell?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Jealous? Of me?
When nobody's looking.
Me? Sure. Why?
That good, huh?
Simple.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
I'm through improvising.
I know.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
A jockey? You mean, like --
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
I might have his number on campus.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Annette will see you.
C'mon, Walter.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I mean... feelings.
Birds.
It's just a city park.
How does it sound?
I bet you can.
Were you watching me?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Have a seat.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I'd say you're moving.
And your new apartment?
But you are taking it?
What?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
No thank you.
What will happen if I do?
Robin, listen to me.
I don't mind.
I said the job is okay.
What?
Why not?
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
What are you afraid will happen?
I mean, when will I be normal.
We have a lot of work to do.
You couldn't say.
How do they know?
I don't know.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Go home, Walter.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
To relax.
Where?
But roughly, how old?
A nap?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I feel... okay.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
It's fucking freezing out here.
I'm talking about you.
Me?
What's weird about that?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
They're all assholes.
They could eat you.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
You think I have a problem?
How many girls did you molest?
How young?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Hey, I'm not --
Depraved? My mistake.
I know.
Most people say the odds are against me.
What odds?
Not ever?
Not ever.
That's not what I meant.
Fine.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Not for long.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Who then?
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Yuh?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
A little more so this time.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
This one is gorgeous.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Have you decided?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And why do you tell us this only now?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
I love you.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
It means being without money.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
What boat?
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
You really must do me this one favor.
He talked to you Himself?
She'd punish me.
He loves you the way you are.
Should you see a doctor?
I just heard you.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
At least once a week.
Oh, yes.
In the confessional.
Down... there.
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
How did she know that?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Yes.
How?
She watches... she listens.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
No I'm not.
May I open my eyes now?
It grew.
I can't tell you that.
I ate.
Hm hmm.
For me to get sick in.
What do you do?
Do you remember what just happened?
Of course you do. Who was it?
For what he made me go through.
Why?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I'll have a decision by next week.
I'll have it.
The one up on the third floor?
Uh huh.
What business is it of yours..?
Unfiltered.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Why haven't you asked her?
Why do you think that?
The science of psychiatry.
What's your opinion?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Oh, Dear God...
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Yes.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
Nothing...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Long, thin and filtered.
Pipe!
I'd like to begin.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
You're saying God did it?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Where is she?
My God, but you're determined.
The scandal...
That's a lie.
Lay them down.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
It is, y'know.
Yeah, she was fickle.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Ah well. Eh, look!
He hasn't.
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Follow your impulse.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Something like that.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Books are good!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
A book!
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
Why do you always use your left hand?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
That little old man.
What?
Hello.
That's what you tell me.
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
Aren't we ...
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
I'll see what I can do.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Unknown.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Well, get started.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Dead.
Hurt!  How?
The engines are fixed.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Yes.
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
We're not going anywhere.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
We sure need this flamethrower.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
No, it's coming.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Okay.
About four hours.
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
What killed it?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
Where are you?
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Who gets the privilege?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Kablooey.
No... don't...
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Yep...
What's happening?
We're what!?
Keep trying!
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Take a look at this.
That's a fact.
Just got a reading...
Where does that lead to?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Six month stint on Datus.
Only six?
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
What time's sundown?
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Just like that.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Stars.
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
She doesn't know.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
She may be later than you think...
Amen.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
It just slipped your mind.
Frankly, I don't remember.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
As of this moment you're six years old...
Many happy returns of the day...
I'll check with Eve...
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
That never stopped you before.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Twenty minutes!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
What's all over?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Here we go...
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Hear, hear...
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Groom.
Yes, dear.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Every day.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
From what would I be running?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
- and for you.
No thanks, Birdie.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Of course!
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
What are you doing here?
How did you get in here?
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
She's got to meet you-
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
There can't be very much-
I'm not crying.
But the raves about your performance-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He can help you.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Of course.
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office?  I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
Why not?
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I'm so happy you're happy.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
I just can't believe it.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Check.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
What is?
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
Incredible.
Don't joke about such things.
Eve?
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Now just a minute!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I never said it was!
She is a louse.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Miss Caswell?  What?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Sure.
'68.
--shit--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
If he self-destructed.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Haldeman.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Maybe we are...
--jeeeeeeesus--
Any idea what he did?
Tell that to Muskie.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
--what?--
Absolutely--
Five hundred; six maybe.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
So tell me about the Times article.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Who by?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
How senior?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Electronic surveillance.
OK.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Will you step forward, sir. 
Government. Recently retired.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I think so.
No.
It may never come out.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
He just did.
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
I won't talk about the other two.
No, none of those.
You need some work, buddy!
Single malt?
You're gonna shit your pants!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
You talked to Stifler?
So you're going to Michigan?
This isn't any better, Chris.
Then don't.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
You fuckin' rule!
Do you know about the clitoris?
Okay, well that about covers it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
She's a mermaid, dude.
For me?
You got in.
Just a second!
Okay.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
I love you.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Ready for what?
What?!  How do I do that?
That's the spirit.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Would you shut up?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
AHHHHHHH!
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Serafine...?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
What...?
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
You on drugs? Huh?
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Oh no... no....
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Yes sir.
Double merde.
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You must have.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
The dessert fork!
I'm sorry.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
What do you mean?
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Young	man, I...
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
You don't want my autograph.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Alvy.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
All right. All right. All right.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Nice car.
Huh?
You want your tennis stuff?
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, yeah.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Why not?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Okay?
As Balzac said...
Good? I was-
H'm?
And blind people, crippled...
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
U-huh.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Yeah.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
I didn't follow you!
You followed me!
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Yeah?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Life. I said, "life."
I'm following you and David, if you-
Oh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
No.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Oh, darn it.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
This is the first book that I got you.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Mean?
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Where?
His wife has diabetes!
They're persecuted enough!
Yes, I do.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
And here, you just-
To code?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Why didn't you come in?
You're fucking desperate.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
The movie.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Who, Sally?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
What?
October-ish.
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
To dander.  Otis.
Didn't I say?
I'd say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Never.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
Fuck you.
Oh.  You're them.
Forget it, Judy.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
I love you, you're a genius.
You want me to uninvite her?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
Really?
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Well he can't have gone far.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Otis!
And how hard it hit?
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
It's a shit novel anyway.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Yes.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I know.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Ah there's our snookums now.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
Hm.
What?
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
What am I, five?
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Not good.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm so sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Do you need anything else?
The charades.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Do Peter Sellers again.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Like the last time.
Okay.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And here they are!
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
And the food sucks, I know.
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
You weren't exactly horrified.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Want a list?
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
That's correct, sir!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Affirmative.
Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
It's a bet.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
Sure.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
So I see.
What gave you that idea?
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
I'll fix you some coffee.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Someone from the office.
What's your friend's name?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. 
Give what up?
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Who'd care?
I don't want to talk to him.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
I know so. He's a taker.
Mind if I come in?
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Yes, sir.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Naturally.
So what's it going to be?
No I didn't.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Slow down, kid.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Something like that.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Sure, Doc.
What's this -- you packing?
No.
Not particularly.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
I'm with you, lover.
Who?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Dreyfuss.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
I don't know.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Come on, Fran.
It's been hell.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Important?
We talked about a lot of things.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I promise.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Lovely. You were a big help.
It's a thought.
Where are you headed?
No -- absolutely not --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
What is this?
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
North ?
Yeah. Way north.
I don't believe you --
That we're dumber than we look.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
Who knows what's up there?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
When'd you do it?
Thta's not Charlie's work --
Touchy.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
About what ?
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Thank you, sir.
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
You know you're right.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
How's the pain?
How's yours?
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I had immense plans.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Nah.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Why?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Why didn't he shoot you?
And shut up.
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Your infrared camera?
Back against the bars.  Now.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
It's exactly what you meant.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
So what's the problem?
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
That makes the flight more interesting.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Forget it.  It would take days.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Where's my ELT?
You don't know how true that is.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.

We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Not bad.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Oh, please...
What are you doing here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Never.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I'll take you... why not?
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
I can trust my brain.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Okay.
You know what? I...
Well...
No!!!
I just love her.  How're you doing?
You think you're kidding.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
It smells like shit in here?
Oh, my gosh.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's it mean?
Where?
Just do your job.
You can't --
I know you're going to jump.
Oh, yeah.
You're too late.
What?
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
Know what?
The contract?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
You didn't know anything about me.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Yeah.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
How old were you?
I was just different.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Tell me about the first time.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Does that mean it didn't bother you?
Taiwan.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
For Nicholai?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I went into their room this afternoon.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Yes.
What happened to her?
Why?
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
Why not?
A dime.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Why didn't you fade?
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Like you?
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
What did the beer cost?
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
It's big, right Jahn?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Nope.
Like helping a sick kid?
We don't speak Czech!
Am I late?
Why don't we go together?
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
I'm not hungry, really.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Yes.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Don't worry it's okay!
Thanks.
Not this time, Kat.
Sure, I've done it easily.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Yep, it's all yours.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Insurance!
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
No, just a coffee.
Yeah, but it was okay.
Cool!
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
That's right.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Yes, if you can get him free.
We're not sure...
-- I like the car I have.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
He wants to show now.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Were you with Jamie?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
You.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Like me.
Good thing.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Looking for something -- someone.
You don't miss a thing.
Yeah --
Or anywhere where people might see us.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
What are you talking about?
Fun.
I'm not applying to college.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
That I want you to take me home.
He wants help with his lines --
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
Yes, sir.
Ever again.
You decide.
I'd work backstage or something?
Thank you.
Scalene?
Yes, sir!
This is 1952....?
No....
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
What drill?
Huh?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
And where am I gonna be?
Operator, what's today's date?
A 35mm film chain... I'll see what I can do....
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Pro, the sun's out!
Oh, right, right... 
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
You know me?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
The power converter...
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Curious... Very curious....
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
The Orpheum.
Hi, Marty!
Does he bite?
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
You love him?
No.
It's okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Well, stop the world.
Something mi trabajo.
Yeah?
No.
Is that all there is to it?
What?
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Why?
How's he doing?
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
What?
Yes.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Yes.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
New Jersey?
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
No, I don't.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Why me?
Pictures don't lie.
Why me?
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
Hah!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I didn't say anything-
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...Barton, is everything okay?
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Pictures! Jesus!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
Seems like nothing but, lately.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
What do you mean?
So they say.
Why don't we go to your room-
You gotta believe me –
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Both maybe?
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Would that be good enough for ya?
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
Bring 1976 up.
No.
Who?
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Nilsen.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.
Ice?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
Sometimes.
That's him.
I never heard of him.
What are you doing here, Pop?
What is it you got between you?
I wasn't there last night, either.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
I'm going with you.
What do you want?
I said keep it.
What about me?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Yes I did.
Let's get out of here.
It's in New Jersey.
That's good. At least they're interested.
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
You name it, I paint there.
You want a drink?
Sure.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
They're just words.
You mean like an ape?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, but as a black painter –
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Good. What do you have?
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
You don't have any fucking money..
Well thanks!
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
You like your dad's paintings?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
So shut up and keep painting..
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Treat to be here.
Yeah?  Me too...
Had one.  Didn't work.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
You first.
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Not all heroes wear masks.
Women.
Be ready for anything.
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
But soon...
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Not good.
What do you mean?
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Apology hastily retracted.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
...A bat.
What?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
And another name for Mystery?
Why's that?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
You are direct, aren't you?
We'll talk some other -
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Nostrovia.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
And into a black dress.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
But...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Good.  With any luck we'll run into each other.
No.
What did you see?
... Looks like a convention.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I feel naked without it.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
What are you, scared of heights?
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Your face smells like a foot.
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
Annie, it's me.
Uh ... yes ...
oh dear.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
You're not going to ....
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
Ahm....
What makes you say that?
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Me first! Me first!
Huh huh huh.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Really? I poop too much.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Thrr...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Ah, the witness?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Where did these guys come from?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, ten uh...
You'll be rich!
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
Oh... I'm sorry...
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Not really...  what's this?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
He might have hurt somebody.
We're ghosts.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
Is this like a trick question?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Help vouchers?
Can you scare them off?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
No, wait!
I want to be dead too.
Step... mother.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
I... I don't know what your name is.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
Why not?
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
A Black man gave me the message.
Yes.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Thank you, Eve.
I see.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes. I like to watch.
No. I'm not busy.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
... Are you sure you like it?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Oh, good.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
I understand.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Oh, I see.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Yes.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes. Of men and women.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Yes. You can take me.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
No, I do not have any of those.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Correct.
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
No headaches?
Good evening, Wilson.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
No! He's a real gardener!
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
No, sir.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Please, have a seat.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Yeah. Okay.
Hmmm.
The ferret?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Schwartz.
Yes?
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
No, really.
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
The usual, Barry.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Sure. It'd be fun.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Ha ha ha!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
You can be John Malkovich.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Think, Jew florist?
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
What's the play?
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Never heard of it.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Whatever.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
You remember Halle.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
YES.
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
She gone like they say?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, good luck with the job.
What you want'em for?
Yes ma'am..
Ya think?
Fine. But what would I do at night?
No..No that won't do...
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Won't you be late for work?
Morning, ma'am.
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Better ask Paul D.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
That's so.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
What yard? When who-
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Yeah. Look bad?
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Oh, man, don't say that..
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Uh-huh.
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Are you gonna split hairs?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Are these.
I see.
Your rug was in the car.
Separate incidents?
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
I want you to see him immediately.
Maude?
What do you do for fun?
Finder's fee?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Am I wrong!
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Calmer than you are.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Huh?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Is the car out front yours?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
This driveway.
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Did I urinate on your rug?
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
A world of pain.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
I'll heal.
Time.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
I want to see the sun rise.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
For what?
I don't know about this, man --
He was here.  Watching us.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Maybe it's better that way.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Scud.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Are we bringing home strays now?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Watch me.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
What happens then?
And that's a good thing?
There is no cure.
Fight him --
He is an abomination!
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
But you use blood banks --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Yes.
Trying to find the energy.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
I don't know.
--you should get back into bed.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
Yeah.
Try a long walk.
What're you doing with all this shit?
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
--who?
--turn the camera off--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Right. And the check's in the mail.
Asleep--
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
By day? No sweat.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Still working on it.
What?
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
Heather.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Does she, goddamnit??
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
--it's urgent!
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Abby...
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...Huh?
Yeah...
Yeah.
What the hell happened, Ray?
...What was that?
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...What?
Pour that back.
Right.
Tuesday.
No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I've seen a few.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Yes.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
No. not at all.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Sure I'm alright. 
I'll go then.
See my nipples?
Yes.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Please. please stay.
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
Sure I do.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Yes.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. it's okay.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
No thanks. what does that mean?
On a ride.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Yes.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay. can I call?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Goodnight.
You like mysteries that much?
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Okay. great!
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Really?
uh uh.
Good deal Dad.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
On the plane.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
You'll see for yourself.
You happy, baby?
Derek!
What is?
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
It's your grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Sell it?
Nice doing business with you, George.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
No?
What kind of project?
I would if I could get some sleep.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Try the back bedroom.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What?
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
I want money.
Diego is my brother.
Yeah.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Dad.
What do you guys want?
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
What is your name?
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
California, huh?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I didn't mean to...
Yes, I do.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
That's right.
I understand. What's your question?
Second district ... Explain better ...
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
I'll explain.
Go away.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
A name?
Why?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Did they argue the day before he died?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
No -- never.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Thank you.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
About a year and half ago.
We were lovers.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
High school?
No.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Then what happened?
Yes -- he did.
How?
Do you remember his exact words?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
He video taped you.
Yes.
Yes.
Three fifteen.
Why'd you come here?
You know I can't talk about that.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
No further questions.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
That's not an answer.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It's okay.
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
You can see me now.
Honey.
Tonight we open new doors.
Are you scared?
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Mr. Roston?
If you want me to.
I'm always open to learning new things.
If he files are you going to take the case?
What's she like?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Why didn't you come to me?
That's too bad.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
It didn't get there from me.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
No. You can have them.
Mom's orders.
Well, there's a problem.
Michael.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Was this during Betty?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
You're right -- that is sick.
She used to be so friendly.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Why?
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Are you all right?
What?
You must get lonely at times.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
What made you ask such a question?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Oh, sure. Great.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
Are you hungry?
Why?
I sat outside and had coffee.
Near the church.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What were your parents like?
What?
What do you want me to say?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Now?!  It's after eleven.
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
I don't.
Died there?  How?
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
What the hell you talking about?
Spooked?
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
You know I can't.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Patrick, he's...
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
From what?
You were just a kid.
Dad?
Daddy?
Don't call me that.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
You want to get into this now?
Open the case!
Where is it?
Yeah, I know.
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What the fuck is going on?
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
That doesn't make any sense.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
Caesar, what are we going to do?
This is insane!
I need you ...
What?
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Just hurry.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Sure, Gino, sure.
Oh, right.
Are you okay, Violet?
Caesar, you still got the money?
Me?  Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
You did the right thing.
A favor?
He said you lost something.
Sure.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
You have to ask?
Almost five years.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
How much money?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Good.
Sweet Jesus.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
An accident.
Shit!  Oh shit!
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
I was so afraid you ...
Hey.
How'd it go?
I know you will.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
What is Treadstone?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
That's all I get?
I don't know.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Right.
Look, maybe I should just...
Sir, you waited on line.
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
Yes.
Thanks.
Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  Cutthroat.
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.
That's what I'm saying.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I thought about it.  I don't know.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- forget it --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
He run away often?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
That'll solve all our problems.
What have you done to my flat?
...elephoned sir.
...ditioning.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
Her name is Jill.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Well, I ...
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
SAM! What a surprise!
Layton! Oh shit!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
You're the only person I can trust.
They weren't at school with us.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Information Adjustments.
Looking for you.
Really.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Will you please turn back.
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
No you're not!
Yes.
But if they did promote you
Would you really, Sam?
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Next of kin!
You are good to me Sam.
I delivered it.
What's the matter?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
What?
Yes.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
What is it?
Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
Ha!!
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
I better just go in and see her.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
IB Bangin.
What did you say?
John, play the Sinatra.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
You asked me not to come.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
No, no.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
I think the worst is over.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Crazy fucker.
Look out!
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
What do you want to break?
Frank!
No shit.
I'm not hungry.
You know what. The radio.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Yeah, you're right.
No way!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Fifty, right?
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Ravenous homosexual.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Yes.
You too.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No!!!!!
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
And Bobbie says...
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Because...
I see the change in you -- I see it.
Okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
...good-bye then.
It's Paul.
I don't know.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
Yes, sure.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Yeah.
Who?
Uh-uh.
Where are you?
Uh-huh.
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
I got promoted for things like that.
I can't be.
Right back to you.
N-no...
You're breaking my concentration!
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Honest?
Murdered man.
Now you're a professional!
All about me...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Hm...
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
I know, man.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
I said I did, didn't I!
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
I-I already got a new one!
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
You might talk too much.
It was.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Uh, I don't know.
Really?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
T-tell him that?
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Coach knows what abs are?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Get away from here.
Eeyuu.
Hi, guys.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I thought we were meeting here.
You broke up with my machine?
I know.
What for?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
That's me.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Get out of my facial.
Wait!
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
Our purposes.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
What?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Buffy...
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Not if you're careful.
How can you keep doing this?
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
And where are they now?
Good enough!
I don't understand.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Oh, baby!
Buffy?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Wit-tay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Right!
Well, look who's here.
Nice much.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Catch?
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Nuke?!
No, no, it was great.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
What a nasty thing to say.
He did?
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
What do you believe in?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
I heard already.
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
You're a cocksucker!
You're outta here!
How?
Gimme that.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Yep.  So how's Annie?
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
What?
And where can I go?
Take the first shot at me.
Hit me in the chest with this...
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
That's right.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner?
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
You got it.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Congratulations.
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Help, Daddy!
Mommy.
No.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Okay.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
You should say so.
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
Yes, you lost your control.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
...hundred yards further down the road.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Sammy.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
No, that's quite all right.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Okay. You come by the house?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Okay. 
I'll be right back.
Why're you crying?
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Yeah.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
Listen...
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
With Jennifer.
Why do you want to do that?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
What if he won't stop?
Oh...
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Listen to me.
You want your jewelry?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
Don't you threaten me!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
That's amazing.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Green?
God! 
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Yeah.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, I've been busy. 
He won't let me go in my house!
And here. Here.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey!
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
You've gotta be kidding me! 
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Carmine left?
What're you gonna do?
I'll tell him, Remo.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Hm.
Ma che cazzo!
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
All right.
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Okay.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Yeah.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yes, you are.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
Thank you. Very nice.
Ginger, honey.
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
He's sittin' by the phone -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
No, I'm gonna drive.
...they're in Penthouse K.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Get up.
Come here, come here.
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
This peter's a motherfucker.
Every night, on the couch.
So are we.
Go fuck yourself.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
I'm sorry.
I know it, I know it.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You are right. What can I...
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
You're serious?  You'd help me...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
And...your point?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
Spear.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
I actually got some memory back last night.
Enough.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
You are...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Theo wants to talk again.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Yes sir.
If you know that just back off.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
And what're you whispering for?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
Who?
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
That makes two of us.
The City National on San Vincente.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Include me in that.
You're going to let them get away with this?
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Whose money is this?
At least one.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
L.A.P.D.
Assure them that you're being well treated.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
You, I would've noticed.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
The money, Nels ... ?
Think you could do a picture of me?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
How about "later?"
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
That's not good enough.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Some loyalty.
Stay there.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Talk to the man.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I won't let 'em.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Thanks.
What you think?
Jimmy.
It's Dave.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
What's it to you?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Must be in love to manage that.
No.
Maybe.
Did he dance with you?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
You think that's wise?
Know what, honey?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Okay.
Anything.
You got the keys to the shop?
No! I'm going home...
You knew my Jody?
Did you hear me?
Try and go, then.
Let them come then.
You do?
Never.
Fergus.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
He's hot.
Eddie and Tinker died.
What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
What?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I understand.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
I seen your fucking face.
My pleasure.
No?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
I got sent.
You could have said no.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Tree.
Like having a pint in the Metro --
What do you believe in?
I didn't.
If they kill me --
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
And you know what?
People. They could be looking.
Nice lady.
No, we are.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
I think that's what you ordered.
You're going to look for him -- now?
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Let's look anyway.
The letter --
Of course there is!
No!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
No thanks.
Only we call them agents.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Agents.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Around one.
Then how do I know this is your office?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Oh.
That's the idea.
Then who does?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There -- you're a new man.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Alex --
I don't believe it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
The kid said --
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Up there! I would put it up there!
I don't know -- how would I know?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is your husband with you?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
How did you find out?
Starting tonight?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
How do you shave in there?
That's all.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
The man you had the fight with.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Don't put yourself out.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Oh la vache!
What's the matter, chérie?
What?
Why?
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
As fucking if.
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
That's impossible.
You're grounded Friday night!
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
I will. Is that all?
A little.
Not much further.
What did you hear?
No?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's underage.
She's not here.
St. Michael's.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Then you should go.
Yes.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
What party?
You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
I did.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Why?
Did Sharon say no?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
What?
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Did he say anything else about her?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Who is she?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Are you Jody?
Kenny's aunt?
Just thinking about something.
What?
What?
No, you keep one.
You can't bring it.
I'm not leaving it here.
But you don't really mean it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.

Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Uh, huh?
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...

...-er.
I got, like, uh....
...doing?!
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
It happens to this piece of shit...
I did not steal this truck!
...the ice cream for money!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
That's...
...fine.
God-...

Kiss my ass!
...you.
...waiting!

...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
All right, you got it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
You okay?
 
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
Okay.
All right.
 Okay.  Okay. 
 Aw, shit  
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Oh, shit.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
So I took his truck, yeah.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
...shit.
...shit.

 Whoo!
...deal with this asshole.
Hey!


 That's why I didn't give it...
You got Elvis?!
Go!

You've gotta be...
Forty-nine point four.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Look out.

Stop limpin' around like that.
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
I think so too.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
Hey!
I did what I could for you...
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...here.   Mason... 

Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...-tor Long.
You have my word on that.
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
Mm-hm.
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
...happen if I drop this?
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason.
...-spite the mouth.


...it.
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
There's something else too.
You got thirty minutes.
...now!
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
Here's what I want you to do.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
...-five.
...-son.
Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
It could be a cover, I suppose.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...and that power...
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Yeah.
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...public drunkenness....
Shut your mouth until I tell you...
...to talk, son.
Then how about if I call you "ass-...

'Course you do, Jake.
An honest living.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Where is she?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
Plus what I owe you?
I'll throw that in too.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
But what?
Or her name?
How do you happen to know her?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
What's the maid's address?
Certainly not!
That's not his apartment.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
...Just a minute...
Oh... thank you.
Well, how much would you like?
It wasn't much of a lie.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Another satisfied client's wife.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What were you doing there?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
And I want to know where.
You saw my fa... father? When?
There hasn't been a lot of time.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Where's the girl?
What did you do that for?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I have to go home and get my things.
...where does Kyo live?
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Okay.
Of course.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
He never even kids about it.
I'm sorry, I --
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Mr. Gittes...
Of course not.
Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
He did or he didn't?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
What about?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Yes. 
We'll talk about that later.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
That looks pretty nice.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
We haven't heard from him.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
No.
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
No.  But you're close.
You really don't know who I am?
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Well, I -
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Can't say, sir.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
What's wrong, Brad?
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
She's going to leave you -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Why is she leaving me?
Yes.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
Yes, sir.
Good!
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
What the hell is that?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
So you're really getting married?
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You're serious. You want to date again.
Let me take you out tonight.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
What time was this?
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
Oooh! Navy Seals!
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Why are the shutters closed?
Did you tell Veronica?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Oh, my God.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
All four?
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Perfect dozen.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
Veronica!
The best Burtless movie ever made.
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I know.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Then where're we gonna play?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
What, your dick?
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
You want to rent a movie.
What?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Please, get the hell out of here.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Really?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
Leave her out of this.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
Make them change.
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
I should start.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
She's my girlfriend.
Oh... Can I help you?
The white kind.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
No; who were the three, besides me?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
That's because I never had sex with him!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
This is different. This is important. How many?!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Sure.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Well, how about these two movies? 
I beg your pardon!
You'll be missed.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Which one?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks?
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I did what I thought was right.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Nice and easy...
Six...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
Why are you yelling?
A flare up...
I only came back for you.
You got to go back now!
You attacked me.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
I won't do it.  No way.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Now you get burned.
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags.
There.  You blind?
Where's the rest of the team?
Get off the radio!
What did you do that for?
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
And you, sir?
How do you do, sir?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Much better, thank you, sir.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
No, brother. What d'you want?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes sir.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
C of E, sir.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Fucking hell...
Yes.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
You got a deal.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
But not now?
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Can't say that I do.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Elvis?
It's nothing.
What's your name?
I was just tryin' to...to...
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
Hang on.  Carefully...
It's home.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You on some kind of work plan?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Like what?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
Okay, try it now.
So?
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
So what?
Yeah.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
No.
What you mean, no?
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
You get benefits?
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
Then what are you?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Why the hell not?
Just drop me off.
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
No.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
What is?
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Yeah.  I think so.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
So what's the question?
Is this your dad?
That was him.
He was murdered.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Right here in Manhattan.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Not today.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Love at first sight?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Could you be a little more specific?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Excuse me?
Only on the football field.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
I don't understand.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
You don't understand --
What do you mean?
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
I don't understand.
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Put it on speakers.
Nice.  Where?
It's beautiful.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Okay, okay... there.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
The librarian... or the library...?
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
That's my girl.  Done.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Jesus --
I'm -- I'm fine.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Prove it.
What'd you think?
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Git movin', I said.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
You jes' watch us!
Borrowin'.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
A Lucas Jackson.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
What you mean, Luke?
On my own.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Damn.
Fear of what...
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Hal has it.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
You come and visit.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
For months... last October.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Okay.
Who came in after you?
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Just horseshit luck.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Tell it to your shrink.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Look at him, grandstanding...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Good.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
We could use a little help.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
One of my suitors.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Then, you should call.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
She said she'd be here at 10.
Ecru.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
Letty.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
Who do you think you are?
So are you engaged, or what?
Good God.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Don't be ridiculous.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Lie down.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Let's try out the bed.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Steak?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
It's hard to know where to start.
The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
It doesn't matter who.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
A pass.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
What?   This?
You're there now?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I only have your word for that.
No problem.
We can't.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
I'm not any closer than you are.
Jesus!
Where are you from?
We'll think of something.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Do I?
I'll be Elvis and you--
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
No?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The Holiday Hotel.
Oh yeah.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I see.   A master criminal.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I'm the driver.
Yeah, I can see that.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
God, I want to go home.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
Fuck you, grease-ball!
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
I know where she went.
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
After last night I could say the same for you.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Why do you want to teach me?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
Shut up!
Really?
What do you think?
You're probably right.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
They forced me to marry!
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Only the sword will settle this.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Don't ever come back.
You were enlightened?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Did you see who posted it?
No, not yet...
Well, we had talked...
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
But the sword could be in his compound.
You buying?
They make you fart.
Mister Funboy lives there?
Wrong answer.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
Yes.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Excuse me?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
I sincerely doubt it.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Give it up.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I can't win with you.
No.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Where are you going?
Hi.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
The football stud?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Okay.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
What are you scared of?
Eyes closed.
Is it that obvious?
Why didn't you do something?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
He made you give him a blow job.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Cool.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
Some other time, Cecile.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
She bought it.
Where is she?!
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
What do you mean?
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Blow me.
Interesting.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Who are you spying on?
What's your problem?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
War it is.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
It's Cecile.
What about her?
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Black.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I did?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
But where did you get it, Amy?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I know that.
That's right.
What do you mean?
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Yes, daddy.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Yes, Amy?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!
That one's an elm.
But we don't have any sea weed.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
That's the clever way to do it.
Let me take another look at that ring.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Because it can't. It's dead.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
She pleaded so to do it
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
At Victoria's Secret.
Oh, on my wrist.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I looked like an Italian man!
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Why not? There's been a murder.
You should have seen it erect.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
About Benito.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
They say sex is great for cramps.
You don't have to pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
You never say that.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
No, she died when I was twelve.
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
We didn't have sex.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Take some allergy medicine.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
And you think I'm sick?
We only live a few blocks apart.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Like a vampire or some shit?
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
His wife.
I see...
You wonít regret this, sir.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Not that.  Anything else.
Yes.
Please...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
What?
Don't worry.
Right and don't embellish.
Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?
... Alright.
No...
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
I know.
Yes.
What about containment, Alan?
Fine.
Oh.  Excuse me.
I'm going to kill him.
What I told him to?
That'd be great.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
Dave...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Oh... Thanks.
Oh.
What about it?
What's that?
You're kidding.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
I don't understand.
Anybody would have done it.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
Thanks.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
But you could go to jail for it.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Look.
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
Gasparilla?
No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Women swoon!
Yeah.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Doing fine, sir.
Yes... sir.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
What happened?
Knox?!
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
No.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
LOUDER!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A crazy madman.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
That's miles.
And now he will?
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
From you?
Oh..
Oh. 
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I'll come to the performance.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
We have to make it to the third deck...
Why don't you want a message sent?
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
Not an option.
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I'm not a thief.
How do you know that?
We can't just leave them here.
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
Forget them...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
I'm looking...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
She fucked you?
Damn right!
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
John,we're going huntin'.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
It's Nick!
Vince thinks... you know...
You don't!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
You mean...?
But you must come in.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
You are his friend.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Oh, well...
Inside, Vince.
Not so good.
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Biederman, yes.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
I don't know.
What?
I don't know.
C'mon. I've got the car.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
Yeah.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What are you, hoping?
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
We what?
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
No!!!?
What do you mean, no???
What?
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Phantom Mary?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
No.
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Yeah.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
I'll be alright.
What are you talking about?
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Aces.
I got it.  I got it.
Ooops, I forgot.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Lean year for role models.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
How do you know?
Yes.
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
Good night, Wade.
Good night.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Then find me some cigarettes.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Simulated one.
...Have you been drinking?
You be careful.
Good to know you, Willy.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
Of course I will.
He lied to me again.
You're lying.
Why? It don't hurt.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
That's just too bad --
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
What Grange?
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
No, you're not.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
Leave your tongue off of that!
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Headache -- Squire?
Camomile tea!
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Worried!
I'll get it, Jabez.
Thanks, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I don't know, Jabez.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'll be there, too!
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Me?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
And if he alters it...?						*
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
New York...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Oh...Where does he live?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Jackie - what are you talking about?
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Hello, Sonny.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
Well...
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Look... don't throw that on me.
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... yeah.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
He's all doped up.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Did you always call him Junior.
Pure?
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
But do you mean it?
We won't have to.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
I'm here.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Open this up!
I speak what I feel.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
We can't stay here.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
You're news, Sonny ...
You could give up.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
What!!?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
What?
Yep.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
I said stop it.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
Something is going down. Something bad.
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
Ask Sal.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
I hope the block is still standing.
C'mere, Doctor.
That's it?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
What responsibilities?
I'll see ya there.
What are you so worked up about?
Nice!
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Whew!
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
Motherfucker you.
It's dug.
ML, hold this for me.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Yes you did.
Can you pay me now?
Can't do.
Tonight, when we close.
C'mon, Sal.
Sal, I want my money.
Do I love you?
I can't be staying long anyway.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
To get my money.
Tina, it's not like that.
You're still late.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
That's right.
Yeah.
I don't know.
If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
I'm listening.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Too many pizzerias already there.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
Actually we have something for you.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Would you like something to drink?
Just down the hall.
Well la de da.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
No no no no no.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Sounds like a pirate.
Now you see why he was elected principal?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
A blimp.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Hey, where'd you go?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
You mean the lunch room?
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.
Okay.
Have you got what I want?
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Oh wow. Look at you.
And, take some more pictures.
Who's there?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Piter.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Let him stand free!
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Pain.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Those sounds could be imitated.
I'd know the difference.
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
It's a pleasure...
Don't you bave a car?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
Rolling.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Will he be okay?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Better than not getting a job?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
That's not true --
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Absolutely!  You see this script..?
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Oh, of course!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
So you're not a fruit?
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Um, I guess --
Oh.  Okay.
Okay?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
What's uncanny?
You're <u>sure</u>???
YES!  JUST DO IT!
I do.
I'm directing.
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Who?
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
Isn't that the same thing?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
They celebrated the common person.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Yes?
What?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
She could've been a nurse.
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
The doctor said you were having sex.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Shari, Ray feels --
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
I missed you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
That's lucky.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Everybody hates me!
So?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
...yeah?
It's nice.
What do we have to do?
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Screw off.
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
It's me, Ed.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Save it.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
No. Two times.
What...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
That sounds good.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Sure.
We'll let it run awhile
Right now?
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
What...?
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Are you sorry she's dead?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
This business, Captain?
Call me Dudley.
How'd you get them to retract?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Richard Stensland.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
What do you want to know?
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
No.
No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Something like that.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
What's her name?
Lynn Bracken.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
How about White?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Down around my ankles.
And Reynolds?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
A bootleg...
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Nothing.
Who are you calling?!
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Listen--
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
I didn't use my name.
How do you know so much?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Yeah.
The NSA killed him.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
Same thing?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
No.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You got any money?
I'm married.
Is that good?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Your stuff?
I'm not his attorney.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
For your wife?
Just for the criminals.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
No.
Well, you know--
It's not true.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I know.
I see her for business.
I know, but listen--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
I don't believe it is, no.
It tastes like fish.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
Why would I--
How can I be sure.
You being audited?
Bullshit.
You have to.
Fuck you. You may have to what?
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
You're Brill.
I don't under--
You're firing me.
Good point.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Why would the Union--
Do I know you?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Who won the fight?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
No.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
Just be cool.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
To the cops?
I have a family.
Yeah?
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
The police?
Why not?
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
Get it.
The originals?
Hiding something?
Dean's with Lyle.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
And if it wasn't?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
No.
Yes sir.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me.
You felt obliged to.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Don't.
I believe you still have my book.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
It's a folk song.
Arabic?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
No.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
I can't move.  I can't get out.
We've got to get you out of here.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
What's the matter with you?
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
No.
Who are his ghosts?
I liberated it.
I think that's called looting.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Very true!
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
What did you say?
The rest meant nothing to me.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
How?  How can you see anything?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's Canadian.
Your friend?
You'd better be.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
I love you.
Thank you.
I follow the wires.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
A toddler
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
How awful.  What will you do?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
I'll come with you.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
No.
Why didn't I think of that?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where are you at least?
I don't want to waste your time.
Then don't.
Uh, yes.
That's good. Terrific.
You...you can't.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Possibly.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
To our...partnership.
Aren't we all.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Got it.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
My job, my rules.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Feeling old?
Four billion dollars.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
You can do it.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
It's never big enough.
It's too soon.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
You're giving them to me?
I figured that out.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Who?
All of them.
There's more than one?
What's your point?
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
So what made you think it was?
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Course I did.
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Whoa.  No shit.
So what are you thinking?
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Erin, it's just a meeting.
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Erin --
I was wrong.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You come to the right place.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
You're married.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
I'm gonna go live with George.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
What do you mean?
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Nothing.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Have you been logging on?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
What?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
I feel The Force.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
It can wait.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Han, we need you here.
What was it?
Or you ran into something ....
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Who's staring?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
You're part of the mining guild then?
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
I understand.
Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
I thought you knew this person.
Let's go.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
I thought I was in good shape.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But tell me why ...
What's in there?
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
With food?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
They look pretty docile.
I'm a psychiatrist.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Cuervo, look out behind you!
Not anymore.
I got a new deal for you.
Can you land?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Does he know how to activate it?
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Right over there.
We'll see.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Who?
You need help.
I'm looking for somebody.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
But your life and lands are far from here.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
Rise, Mordred.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Because you and the land are one.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
That I cannot.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
I see, your excellency.
In here!
Oh great, anything else?
No kidding.
Phonograph.
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
Oh, I see.
What's her name?
Rats?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Depression?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
No.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
What else?
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
No, is Regan aware of it?
Are you sure?
In Europe.
Your kidding?
Oh............
You like it?
Oh it's so funny.
I found it.
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Cause I like it.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
But you like him.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Damien Karras.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
In time.
No now.
Holy water.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Merrin! Merrin!
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Save your servant
And let my cry come unto thee.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
What's this about?
It's possible. Possible however…
Bastards! Stop!
Is it Captain Howdy?
You're not going to drive!
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Baker.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
How many?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
My pleasure.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Count it.
I hate your kids, Frank.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
No, I mean it.
Says who?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Talk.
It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
All right.  What's your name?
You're getting cold feet about this.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah.  Something.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Just a lucky guess.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
A few bars!
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Okay.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What?
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
No.
I don't know. Some disease.
You don't know?
Seventy-one
What?
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
Fuck you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Five years ago.  November.
Doctor's orders.
Miss --
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
Changed?
Where's your dress?
Am I missing something?
Time for what?
I wear a seven.
Zip me up?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Yeah.
Peggy Lee?
Forget it.
What?
Yes, well, they are.
Is that important?
Born and bred.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Yeah.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Is that the way it is?
For a while.  She left.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
You want me to walk you?
Just dinner and dance, right?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You sending me home?
He had a mind that escalated things.
There's always another girl.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Why not?
He's losing his teeth.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
He hit a guard.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Is that what you think?
We need to talk.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
What do you mean?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Would it?
Not anymore.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
The Admiral?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You can't blame me for trying.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
Call me spontaneous.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
Is that tonight?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
I’m sure you do...
Oh, I’m hearing you, Alan. That’s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I don’t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and don’t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
Bye...
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Great room...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
So could you write down her exact address?
All I’m saying it there isn’t a guy in Union County who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
No.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Damn, you are the real thing...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
What the hell is happening to me?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
C’mon, Jack...
It would help me if we were.
Mr. Mintz?  I don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  You’ll have to come back tomorrow.
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
All in one tape?
I don’t know!  Please stop yelling at me!
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because that’s where I live.
Because you’ll be here.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
I’m working on a new deal now...
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
What...?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
It’s wonderful...
That’s all I wanted to hear...
It’s like a museum.
For the week?
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
To Paris. Paris, France.
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Youthful high spirits.
Solid.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
Ben, are you there?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
I though we went over this.
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Sure.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Which was?
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Raising the shields.
Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
<Me>?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Say that again?
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
It's only for an hour --
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
We'll know -- in the next breath...
But big enough for us...
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
What do you mean?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
I've done all I could with the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
It's too late!
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
I'll do what I can.
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
That's my license and registration. I wanna be in compliance.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
Oh, geez.
That's right. And we need more money.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Uh-huh.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Ya got that right.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
A subconscious-type thing.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
No. No, ma'am.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Okay, real good, then.
Be back in a minute. If Stan calls you, just tell him I went to Embers. Oh, geez -
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Stan Grossman called.
lot. It's a limited -
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
No, that's okay.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Thanks, hon.
They're real good.
No, no.
Three-cent stamp.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Well... Why don't we...
He was killed in action.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
I'd like to thank the academy...
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Really?
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
It's for men.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Nothing.
I don't know.
Guy or girl?
He's not here.
Is this a trick?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
What?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Okay, everyone.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
A hotel?
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Go ahead.  Say it.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Me?
I know that.
No.  Not at all.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
Look at your hand.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
It isn't... ?
Imagine how he feels.
Tyler...
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
... is over.
"Applicant?"
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
And, sometimes you control it...
What... what are you saying?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
I quit.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
Why what?
You need me.
You will.  You know you will.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
How'd you know?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
I...I...
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
May we come in?
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
That it's not over yet.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Thirty-nine.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
You stopped.
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Batteries not included.
I've seen worse places.
No cigarettes.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
I need a vacation.
Let me see.
Nothing we can do, man.
Yes.
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
I'm not jumping blind.
We just take pictures?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Christ almighty.
What that?
Am I out of here?
Those men are all dead.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
Fine.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Got any more bread crust?
Most men are.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
And who's Lydia?
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
Fine.  I'll say no.
Which ones?
A list.
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Great place huh?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Parry!
Can I take you to lunch?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
I don't drink coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
You have a disease.
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
No.
Now, now.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Is what you?
Okay...
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Why are you being so mean?
Swimming?
Nothing.
I think it's what you think.
I'm fine.
I have to talk to you.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Yes.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
That's what I mean...
All right, let's have a rematch.
It's all right. I'm fine.
I don't think that's true.
Besides being very rude.
No, I wouldn't.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Look at me.
What?
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
I'm wit' Carlos.
What are you doin' here?
You know somebody around here?
So what's her name?
Just chill.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
C'mon.
I think by Twenty-two.
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
Positive.
What?
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You're kidding.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Can I ask anybody now?
We play tennis at the club.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
No idea at all?
Gum thought Brazil.
You're in the Records Room.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Are you serious?
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Of course.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Course he has. That's his wife.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
No problem.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Yeah. Maybe.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Come inside.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Sure, all drifters do.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
You doing a story on this guy?
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
You've met her?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
John Ultrarelamensky.
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I mean put clothes on.
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
How do you know about that?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I was afraid you'd say that.
You shouldn't be here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
One.
Muchas gracias.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
What?
Who are you?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Who?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
Not really.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Uh, let's go sit down.
Have what?
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
You're saying you need money.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
You're not funny.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Fluck you!
Ye-ah.
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Who cares?  I got a case.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
What's fine?
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Only on a first name basis.
That's cute.  You're funny.
That's funny, you're cute.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
I'm clean.
Cause if I do.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Goodbye.
Yes --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
It's your problem.
Comment va-t-elle?
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
We must follow it.
But will they?
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Where the hell is it?
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Give who a tail?
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
I'll go find Hayes.
I seem nervous, huh?
Did he?
Sure.
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
I love you more.
Luck, my ass.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Glad to hear that.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I don't know.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
No wait, don't go!
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
H-hi.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
In my pocket.
What's wrong?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
Your bed.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
What?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
You promised you'd never ask me.
You're Shelly?
I never said you were "nothing".
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
I found it outside.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
You gotta be kidding!
Yeah, we're here.
Yes, but they released me because...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
'Night, Josh.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I'm literally going to kill you!
Jason...Voorhees?
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Ask me in about five minutes.
Tell me.
Right.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
And you'll never do it again.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
I heard you weren't coming.
I'd love to.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
Don't talk like that.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
I'm not ready.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
He'll hate it.
This could be it.
About what?
In and out of bed.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
Do you want to get some coffee?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
I have a class. I'm late.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Alma Wetzel.
It violates so many trusts.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Oh yeah?
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a simple subject.
Then say it.
Because God loves a winner.
They're my team.
What about my play?
You're out of bullets.
Why?
Burnt sienna.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Endearing.
Say it again.
I hear good things about the new play.
No one's waiting.
Yes.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
One more.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Somehow I expected not.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Have you found him?
It's over.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'll take care of it.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Something's not right.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
From what budget?
Where do we start?
Surely you know what you have.
It's about the Director.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Any particular reason?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Michael's.
Where are you going?
That's the hair color in his profile?
Let's walk.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
Stay clean.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
No way. I've got to get out now.
Sure...
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Where did you get them developed?
Is he straight?
You got the parole, didn't you?
Yeah... I know.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
For exits off Main Street.
That bad?
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
And switched keys.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I'll bet you can.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
I don't want to hear it.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Can we make it?
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Just get your clothes on...
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Might try that.
Yeah. I got out.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Then you do it.
Come on. How much?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
I got a nurse in mind.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I'll tell you when.
What happened to this car?
Never mind.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
I work for him.
No, do you really?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
We're there now.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Have another?
That must be interesting.
Did you work with him, Keith?
That's what I was wondering.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Don't know.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
How many?
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Don't ask me.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Making a living.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Nasty way to go.
That's right, Harry.
Ha.
Deadbeats all.
Well, I think I had one once.
They did.
It's too...
I...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
With River Oaks?
What?
Huh.
You fucking build it!  Men come...
They have...
When they...
What?
Someone should hurt them.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
What will he pay?
What?  What?  The leads.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You.
I...
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
...and rob the place...
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
So I'm making it concrete.
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Down the street.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Where did Moss...?  I...
You understand?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
In school.
That they're going to be upset.
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Who are you?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
...do you want to go downtown...?
...no...
Not lately it isn't.
...you talk to Murray...
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I will close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I'm not sure I have two.
Because I say so.
You want something off the B list?
That's alright.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
No.  It hadn't.
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
Who kept the other half?
Mmm.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Why?
Last night, this morning.
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Me.
Yeah.
What do I...?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
To...you know.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
Not to my knowledge, no...
The...
Yes.
I...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
Your contract went out to the bank.
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
What if we don't pay?
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
Then why do you come to me?
Tom is right.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
We're making an investment in Havana.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
How long does this go on?
That's not the way we look at it.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
He's not the same as when I met him.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
I took care of it.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
It was a boy.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The room has a bug in it.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
You're right.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I don't think that's necessary.
This meeting is adjourned.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Does it feel like a boy?
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Let him gamble.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You want a war?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I wasn't going to try anything.
It never crossed your mind?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Why?
A homo?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
But I didn't do this!
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Really?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Did anyone laugh?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You are much too human.
Don't move.
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh Clayton.
Fuck off!
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Then take the pills.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Yes.  Perfectly.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
So what do I do?
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
Luminal.
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
Point-five ...
I don't want him hurt...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
And if he doesn't make it -- ?
Get out --
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Your girl works in there ...
Not my girl anymore
Got it ...
We're partners here --
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
We'll take it.
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
I dunno ...
You all right -- ?
Yeah -
Okay --
About what?
"About what?"
Otto called -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
You boost her -- ?
Now, we go -
Hospital.
We're going shopping -- !
What are you doing here?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
That's what I want ...
Oh, yeah.
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
You remember Junie?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Billy, how are you?
What?
I understand.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
What bag?
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I got seared.
What?
Have a drink first.
Don't worry about it.
So what?  Where are they gonna go?
I better call again.
Yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
What? Come on!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
I don't know.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
What?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
No, I had to talk him down.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
How you doin'?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
It's an integer proof.
I happen to know so.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
Hey, how you doin'?
I did.
I've been busy.
Since Nancy died.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Now wait a minute--
--Gerry--
Hold on!
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
What's the point?
What do you want to do?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
You're right. I know.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
You think so?
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
This is a real piece of shit.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
Fine.
I don't know.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
That's right.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
Here's my number.
Okay, sounds good.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
No I haven't...
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Well...
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Then let's go have some fun.
I've never seen your place.
I want you to come with me.
Yeah, but how do you know?
Is that what you think--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Yes, I do, Will.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
But ain't no reason--
Sure. Why not?
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
You're *ticklin' me!*
People done it. If they could, we could.
Gallon or two?
I didn't see nothin'.
Four.
Kids?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Which way is House 25?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Joad. Tom Joad.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
That's our place.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You been acrost?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Sure. We aim to.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
They gone.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Casy, won't you say a few words?
You're tootin' we're gonna stay. 
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
I wisht it was day.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You're so funny...
What?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
To make a long story short...
Yes.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
I'll think about it.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
--She's not dead---
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Not the other way around...?
You're a government spook?
Jesus Christ!
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
I'm staying here.
You don't understand...
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
You know where I live?
Mmm.
What stuff?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Wait a minute--
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
He sold me this bad boy.
As long as you had a good time.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Thanks.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Fine!
I don't care.
That's not true!
Hi.
You already did.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Exactly...
All right. Speak to you then.
Riding with Judith.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, let me go.
Doing what?
Why did you go?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
How are you feeling about work?
What do you mean?
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
You know her?
Yeah.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Mmm. An editor.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Cool?
You think it's cool?
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
How are you going to take care of the cops?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Dead?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
What's this one eat?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Yeah.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
You what?
I'll make it up to you!
What?
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
Cancer?
My name is the Plague.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
D'you bring those Crayola books?
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
What?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You're late.
I'll take you down there.
Don't get angry.
Michael Myers.
Look.
Brady! Come with us.
Brady!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Why not?
How do you know their not?
How many people in the bus?
How many bodies did you find?
It's been eleven months.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
It was the nightmare man
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
This is great Rachel. Come on.
No.
Don't you mean what you do best?
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Go get it.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Dear God.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Huh?
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
That's probably all he can do.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Totally...
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
They may be right.
Could have...
You all right?
Sure...
I found the car! He's here!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
Well, she's totally not here.
Just watch.
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
The bogyman!
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
No! Do as I say.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Yes, she is.
I'm wasting time.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Only minimum security.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Mm-mm!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Let's take a look.
When did you first notice this?
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Yes, but you name names.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes?
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
No, I don't have time.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
He's got like six gold records.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
What are you doing?!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
It's so late.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Are you in love with someone else?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Who is it?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Jesus...Jesus!
No--
Like what?!  What?
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
You've outdone yourself.
You look so beautiful.
No.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
Thanks, thanks.
That's a beauty!
...from Mavis, also.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Well, how about this?
Really?
Uh-huh.
Easily.
I hope.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Good.
Well--
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Yeah?
...namely a personality.
I'm okay.
Have you?
You have.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
I am.  You-you made my day.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
It's all right.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
...you...
Yes?
Say it in English.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
And who is "they?"
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
They got that kind of money?
...what a world.
You take this much time over everything?
...are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
...young boys, still...?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I am all attention.
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I'll have them picked up.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
I have had the honor. 
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Enchante.
Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
Where do you live?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I realize, you're under a lot of....
Spoken like a Protestant.
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
...and that is what you need to expand.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Because...?
I want the money.
What shape is the scar?
...I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
You're all making me blush...
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.

I think your passion is terrific.
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
You're beautiful.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Never say never.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
No. Hell no.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
What do you want from me?
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Uh-huh.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I don't know. Should you?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Chick-en.
And your worst enemy.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Of course.
May<u>be</u>.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Cool off, we're seniors.
I guess.
Superb.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
Look who I've found!
frowns at Henry.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
I'm not hungry.
is very angry.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Fruit.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
You're such an incredible woman.
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
Yes . . .
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
All finished.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
What's the occasion?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Where's Allison?
Uh... eighty two?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
It's perfect.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Thanks.
We're all here for you Trevor.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Ambulance.
Two.
Wow you are out of it.  
What things do you think you've done?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
YOU!
Well now there's a compliment.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Nothin'.
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
JOEY!
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
John, I know all about it.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Unprofessional.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
What toys do you have?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
-- institution.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
Yeah, that was easy.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
But it's what we want.
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
Huh?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
There's no card or anything.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Where should I hide the car keys?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Right over here.
Promise.
Would you?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
What?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.  I don't scare easy.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Yes.
That is what bothers me.
Leaving what?
For what?
I stood up first.
That doesn't matter.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
You'll no see me again.
Do you love me, Conner?
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
I know.
So?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
I don't know.
It has to be.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
This cannot be.
Me too.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
Keep trying.
The best.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
Not if they're looking at something else.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
How about the cop?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I gotta piss real bad.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
I'm getting a doctor!
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
I don't know.
I don't eat junk food.
You fucked up, Glen.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
You said they would be here!
Close.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Where are they?
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
You have her cell number?
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I guess we do.
We, who is we?
A delegation.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
What did they say?
The front gate would be best, General.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Oh my God!
Fuck you.
Thank God.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Promoted. House Manager.
This goes out live?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
That will take time.
The commander is not here.
He will be here.
What cards?
You have our cards.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Please, be quiet.
We have been abandoned.
It was substantial.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
Please do not talk like this.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
I'm confused.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
I'm moved beyond words.
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Oh dear.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
And I think that's case --
Did it work?
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
-- that's the fact, bud --
It'll have to do.
It's succeeding!
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
I know.
-- in the act.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- wit...nesses --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And here's your goddamn severance!
Maybe if I --
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
I can't comment until I get paid.
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
He would have been back by now.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
She's down...how do you mean honey?
For good luck honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Daddy help!
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Must be...
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
So what are you saying?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
Ok...
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
We're not going.
In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
What's going to happen?
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
No.  Thank you.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
But I said I was sorry....
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
Why not just go now?
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Get em....
Yes way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
A little petting is not the issue!
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
God go with you, sister.
Never, why do you ask?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Oh, you read that.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
Uh....old badminton injury.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Actually he never told us what it was.
I guess that's a no.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You certainly do.
Shucks.  Guess not.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Tell me about it...
Sharp.
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
...You do?
...Huh?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Your i --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
As a three-dollar bill.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
But, buddy, you were --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
But Buzz --
Norville.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Geez, I --
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
But, sir! --
Oh my God, sir!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
She's looking for her mark.
She sits down.
...adenoids.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
At the Houmfort.
Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
I'm afraid so.
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I've never heard of a cure.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Yes, thank you.
I am not a frightened girl.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I'm sorry...
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I love Fort Holland.
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
Yes.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
So maybe you'll come too?
So early?
Rough day. Good night.
Hmm. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
I have no idea.
Don't be dim.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
You're not going to --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
Gotcha.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
It's what?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Oh Wendy.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Forget how to ride a bike.
That's right.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Um, Libbets Casey.
What?
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Would it matter?  And what's that?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
No one.
Geometry?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Greetings, Charles.
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Hey Sandy.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
One more shot?
That's all, for now.
Good.
Actually...
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Then change it.
What I saw?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
No.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
He's asking everybody questions.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
How should I know?...
Good to see you, too, Randy.
My arm!
Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
I suppose.
Yes.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
No back-up.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
Is this my birthday?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
He jests.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Still my beautiful child.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
That's not so.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Yes...
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I tried...
Yes.
How could I not? She had to know.
Yes...
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Don't even think about it.
Okay, I won't.
No.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Just kidding.
They never found the body.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Never do that again.
I told you.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
How much?
The rest of us see bathrobes.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
How's the water?
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
My friend -- what can one say --
This was once a cemetery.
They were gore before I came here.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
I was looking for you.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
What an odd question!
My last name is Pherides.
Miss Wollsten!
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Who?
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
They went out of business years ago.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
I'm all right.
Please don't go away –– please!
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
And all's fair in love and war?
Yes, sir.
No.
How's that?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Did you get a doctor?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Right down here.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Five hundred dollars.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
In that place?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
That does it –– come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
To keep from being an old maid.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
You have no idea what happened . . .
I don't care. It's George's tux.
You forgot something.
So's mine.
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Stop paddling!
It's not going to be easy.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
We'll take your supercargo.
There's a shark....
The rope!  The rope!
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Got it.
Every day?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Right.
MMMmmmorning....
Door's locked.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Do you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Just one minute....
Going out.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
Now I really want to see it.
Waiting for Andy.
Help!  Help!
That's a crock of shit.
I know.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Next week.
Just like this.
Is there something I don't know about?
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
You going with Patrick?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
Maybe.
Michael....
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
No.
Want another one?
You will.  I'll see to it.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Okay, bye.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Yes.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
How's your patient?
I can't take water, Kathryn.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
Still sleeping.
Just watch it when he does.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Ten minutes ago.
Someone's looking for you.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Sure am.
And alone.
Yes, it's great!
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Gotta sneeze.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Look great, don't I?
So was Dad.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
But you always let me....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Yes, I did.
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
No way....
We need milk....
Turn it off....
They're at the beach....
Whatever happens next.....
You make sure they come?
Adds flavor....
You check it....
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
I'm still five....
Thanks for the consultation....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
I'm fine....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
Why'd you come out here?
Why'd you take the boat?
Sure you can....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
Nothing....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
That's hard to imagine....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
Get her started....
Still tagging conch?
She's a tough lady....
Oh, boy....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Maybe it's gone....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I didn't ask you to....
What about Carla's gig?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
How come only me?
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Oh, Jake... 
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Good night, Polly....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
How'd you do it, old man?
What do you mean, Ross?
Why?
To throw out of the window.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
No .. You didn't know that ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Bits.
What d'you mean, "bits."
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Vehicle references.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
Why not? You heard my voice?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Of course I would ..
You should. It's wonderful.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
What was she like?
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
You are not a loser.
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I think you added the "brutal."
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
I see what you're saying.
Bill, Rod, wait --
My son... my mind...
Oh tsht. Yes.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
It's all going to work.
Call me later, hon.
We will be fine!
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
You don't have to explain.
Yeah, what happened there.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Easy, easy --
What --
I don't know --
He's in the living room asleep.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
I'll give it everything.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Let's do it again.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
That's your word?
No, I air-dry.
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Go.  Flee.
What --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Well.  Good luck with that --
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
To the pools?
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Damn right.
Don't be silly.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
You wanted smaller.
Funny...   I better go to bed.
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
One way to find out.
What is it?
He says it's a bad idea!
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
People change.
I filmed this the morning they left.
We have to help him.
Think.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
DAD!
Just hold on.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
I thought you were an expert.
It won't hold!
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
You think they could talk to each other?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
No we're not.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Back out! Move!
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
John . . .
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Okay.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Piss.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
What do you think they want?!
No way.
Why should they?
Because it exists.
But why?
Damn!
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
Alan!
Why not?
Alan, listen to this.
Unpredictability....
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Tim.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
I doubt it.
"Thunder lizard!"
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Relatively.
What?  What can we do?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
It's safe.
Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Wait a minute?  What do you mean "worked"?  Everything is still off!
Thanks, Dad.
That was great!
Ken, we've been through this...
No, but...
Who is this? What's going on?
Other guy?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Come on.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
How do we prove it?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
_It's a second REM pattern_.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
Another one?
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Then its authority is in doubt.
I gave it to him yesterday.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Sit down, Kafka.
Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I've heard of it happening.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
No, I suppose not.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
It's a farce.
It's gone out so quickly?
-- You mean my Chief has it.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
Now Ann ...
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Compassion.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
You think people hate you.
So do I.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I guess he figured it was better.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
You said that.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Gee.
Why?
Mm.
-- OK?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
No.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
You said it was!
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
I was wondering what that was.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
How do you know how bad it was?
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Trask --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
Does that distress you?
What do you like best about your daddy?
Show...
What if she forgets?
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
Is that really your chair?
No, she never did.
I do not, your honor, however--
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
No, I did not.
And what is your present salary?
Yes.  Very much.
Eight, almost nine years.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
No.
I...I don't know...
Yes.
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
What about Billy?
I'm not taking him with me.
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
What?
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Beautiful.
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
She'll be back...
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I'm going to take it.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Fine.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
John, what if she kidnaps him.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
What d'you tell her?
I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Are you? Of whom?
Are you, General?
Soon.
We did not.
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
He is a capable man.
Me. First break of day.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
I do not know, Holiness.
Look here!
And, America?
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Pretend.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You, kill me?
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
We cannot.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Oh, yes.
Go ahead.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
I coulda shot you, you--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
So profound and fat.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
He never said "go".
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
I'm just saying last resort.
As if.  Will you miss me?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
They could try to tranq him on land.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
Never been to Maine before?
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
That's probably good.
What are you talking about?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Ssssh!
I'm not mushing it.
We might as well pack.
You wouldn't?
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
You wanna ride in my truck?
Yeah.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Probably not.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Not yet.
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
Sheriff.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Me too.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
It's ten after nine.
Yes, well...  famished.
I want you to go there.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Why not?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Sometimes.
You're all right! Where is he?
Get me out!
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Good idea.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
I think so.
All that detail, just from memory...?
Five... so far.
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
I never thought about it.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
I - ran away...
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
No! That's incidental.
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Did you breast-feed her?
Let us go, miss.
You knew them.
What?!
No. I will find you.
Maybe...
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
He delivered no such message.
We were headed...
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
Ottawa!
Your enemy...
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
What else?
That's all, sir.
What did you see, Major?
By your leave, sir.
You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
Fire!!!
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
La victoire.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Why Sixpack?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
He did.
Just get in yours!
What?
You screw around like that again and--
Why can't we pick up his signal?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
No...she killed herself.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Hook's on 24...
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
What music?  There ain't no music.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
What are you going to do to him?
DeJesus...It's got him.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Right.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
It's a Samoan pub.
You get the guns?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Try that one.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
And the weed?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
Right as rain.
A hundred grand.
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
For half a million?
Yes?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
My van is half full.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
So?
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
That isn't true.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
Best part of the job.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Cliff--
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
We been through this before--
Have we had trouble there before?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
What's in the back?
Protection?
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
'57, 1 believe--
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Right.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Bledso
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Hey, Sam.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
I don't mean Fernando.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
What?
Time marches on.
Got him here?
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
Yeah.
They've got me. Different thing.
Yeah?
So what are we gonna do about this?
Two years.
What was your father's name?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Yeah--
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
How 'bout you?
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
He's gonna find out.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
I could scoop them out.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Harry.
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I can be very persuasive.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
He taught all this to Swann?
You said you weren't with him for love.
I wasn't.
Nothing?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
Quaid and Jennifer--
You can't.
I... have... to.
You saw this?
Oh God.
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
I'd like to hear them.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
I don't think the dead much care.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Shit...
Don't bother.
What about?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
What?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
Oh yeah?
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Will that do?  No?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
You didn't try hard enough.
I don't know.
Try.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
A couple of weeks.
Maybe... I... don't...
Yes! Yes!
No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Yeah, I'll stay.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
How long have you been married?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Really?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh.
Yeah? But look at you.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Because that would be too easy.
Yeah, look at that thing.
Yeah.
Well... have a good flight.
I don't think so.
Hello, darling.
What are you talking about?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Alright?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello?
Do you want to- 
Ok.
Great.
One moment, please.
What?
I got some hair stuff.
It's ok if you are.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
I don't know.  What are they?
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
What time did you make it for?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
My secretary?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
He will.  He has great faith.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Miette, come here and relax.
How many weeks are you honey/
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
I had to.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
So what?
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
That's true.
No oxygen to the brain.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
It's Detective Smythe.
There weren't any voices.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Pants.
I can manage.
To that stewardess?
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Thanks, sweetheart.
What'd you do?
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Mom's going to hate it.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
No.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
She hates all freshmen.
Didn't have to try very hard.
Just like that?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
So?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Please.
Big-ass titties?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
Your hot-ass temper.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
You sure?
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
What are the doctors saying?
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I forgot, "Q-man."
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Kiss my ass.
Figured it was something like that.
Getting there.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
For what?
And what happens when you lose?
Nona, please.
We still have to go?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
He's not my boyfriend.
I don't wanna talk to you.
GET OUT.
No one else in there with you?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
No.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
ok.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
It's ok.
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Yes I do.
Claudia What?
Where's Richard and Julia?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
-- Richard.
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
DAD.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
This sounds threatening.
Might of been before my time.
Brad, dear?
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
You mind your own bussines.
Yes.
Your teeth are fine.
Don't do this, Don.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
I'm trying.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Jack.
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Like I said, yeah --
-- just to clarify --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
She's retired.
From '84 to '89.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I am calm.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I don't have to answer your questions.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Marcie.
I don't know a loud crash.
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Come home soon after the show.
Yes.
No.
Two years...three years...
Do you know the answer to this?
Did you ever touch her?
But you can't say....
You should know better.
She's asleep.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
I'm trying to help, Linda --
I have to go.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
mmm.hmm.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
But --
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who?
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
What is that?
Whose rooms are those?
D'Artagnan...
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Your Majesty has had many women --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Thank you, your Majesty.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
You set to go -
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Don't worry -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
I'll live...
Did he harm the girl?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Yeah?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Figure you would have tried it already.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Found what?
No -
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
OK...where do you want to start?
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Are you a regular there?
Where is he?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
That was Peterson upstairs.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I don't recommend it.
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
No.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
You look all right now.
Why?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
See? You do know something about him.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Tell me now.
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
I'll get my purse.
Me.
No!
Was I in an accident?
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
In a little while I'll help you understand.
No. I don't want to see you.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
You will tell the truth?
Yes?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Why do you think I called?
Goodbye.
What happened to them?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I remember.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
What's this Mama shit?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Yes.
We don't know that.
...yes.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes.
Do you dream much, Will?
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Kevlar Second Chance.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Twenty!
Hi... am I late?
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
I can shtop whenever I want...
You're NOT DYING!
Okay.  You're probably right.
What?!?
Each show is worse than the next.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Are you sure?
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Oh.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Goddamnit!
The agents --
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
More important than what is when?
Your training.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
The body cannot live without the mind.
I think I do.
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
Of the Resistance.
She helped you?
He is the One.  He is the One!
You're the Oracle?
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
From what?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
They're hacking his mind.
Neo, this has to be done!
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
He's alive.
Know where he is?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
You sure?
Why?
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou art then a king?'
She don't look Jewish.
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Not quite...but keep trying.
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
I understand.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Mind your own business.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Get him in.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
How much?
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Hostess?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Do you have enough?
Here.
It's all right.
Maybe, who knows.
What is it now?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
I know...I know.
This is a heisted car!
Shut up.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Sure.
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
You think so?
He's cute.
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Of course.
Oh, the goddam party --
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
Right away.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Am I not obligated to?
Why yes, thank you.
What an odd pairing.
Of whom?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
The dagger --?
Do you think I need a haircut?
Me, too.
As close as a deal could be.
What do you mean?
I am now.
As much as Joe's?
Please, Drew.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I know.  Gum up the works.
Thanks, Quince.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
Don' need you okayin'.
No.  Nothing.
Jennifer.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Love.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Yes.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Yes!
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Then don't.
We know all that we need to know --
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
No.
Good night to you, Bill.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Goodnight.
Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
I'll be the judge of that.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Say again?
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Then what is it?
Those were my words, Bill.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
And we're very grateful.
Thank you.
I guess you have your reasons.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
Death!
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
What do you mean?!
Get what?
Time.
Good morning, Quince.
How's that, Quince?
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
You're terrible.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Joe?
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Nothing lasts.
No, it was so right it scares me.
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I think I know her.
That's it?
Burt.
Hi, Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Quiet!
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Yes.
Don't remember.
What?
Who did he go to meet?
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
And what did he say?
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Why would you do that?
Somebody's come. Already.
No!
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Shut the fuck up!
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thank you.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
You've read it a hundred times.
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Mr Gammell?
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Natalie who?
Who's she?
She's involved with these drug dealers.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I have money.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Why not?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
I was the kids' godfather.
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Tell them what you want.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Make it 40%.
Deal.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Is it December?
Do I need it?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
What's the point?  It's going down.
Switek?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Have faith.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
On the phone.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
What's it say?
What would you do...?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Men, they mostly faggots.
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
Okay. Never argue with a man.
For money.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Oh hell, forget it.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
I mean, dammit, where you live?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Yeah, well, so?
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Don't need a comb.
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
And what?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
I'm wet.
Gin's okay.
It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
What?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Don't make me laugh.
Ziat!
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
I'll pay extra
But just...
Beats working.
Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
He wasn't even in the car?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah? Where?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
That's a great philosophy.
Who?
What's your name?
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Yeah...?
There's some weird shit here.
New York's finest.
I think so. One right, two lefts...
No, you talkin' at me.
Across both tracks!!
Right.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
How long...?
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
No, just the paper will be fine.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
Be my guest.
What things?
Four or five days ago. Why?
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
What?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Yes.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Ahh..
Mmmm.
And my room?
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
To do what?
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
And the check's in the mall.
They've got a book for this?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
And that's the only reason?
Yes?
Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No.
No.
What did you think of him?
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
That simple, huh?
I told her to get outta there.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
Okay!
What about him...?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I'm going to answer it.
You didn't have to.........
This stuff is so sticky.
Claire.
Go secure.
Are you damaged?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yeah.
Yes.  I see your point.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
Profitable.
About what?
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Like Job?
Why, may I ask?
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Let's move!
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Just don't chew it.
I'm willing to take the chance.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
No.  Abort.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Good luck.
Jack...that's spying.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
That's not so good for you, my friend.
This wasnít what we discussed.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Very good.
Thank you, Rose.
I'm going to bed now.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
The guy died.
What killed him?
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
What are you doing here?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
You have too many dogs.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
That's it.
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
Fast.
I don't know.
What are you doing!
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
Where are you taking me?
What about Johnny?
That light.
What did I do?
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
Alright.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
For what?
I wanna go home.
How can you ask me that?
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
What!
Will you marry me.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
Will you marry me?
What do you mean?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
And we'll sell the house.
No. He don't.
Are you drunk?
No. Are you drunk?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
No more he's not.
She recovered.
Did you see it?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Talk to him.
Come on in.
Where is she?
You don't know where Loretta is?
Good.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
What happened?
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
I guess you can't invite me in?
You mean the whole house?
It's a house.
Cosmo.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
You see that moon last night?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Yes!
I'm not interested.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
King of the WHO?
Well, who is your lord?
'Tis but a scratch.
Course I have.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
My liege,  I am honored.
Ni!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
What?
I warned you!
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
The nose?
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
I'm not dead!
What is your name?
Right.  Off you go.
I can't take him.
Thursday.
And another!
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
What - the curtains?
Father, lad.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
No.  Until I come and get him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Quick!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Well ... yes ...
No, no, no.
Sixty.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
You watch your tongue.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Are you all right, Barney?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
A situation?
Whom you address.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
My own.
How will I know?
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I am a blank sheet.
I don't think about it.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Yes, ma'am.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Yes.
What?
Aye.
Yes, ma'am?
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Well, both.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
To know when he'll be king.
You can't know that for sure.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
I have a letter, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
You imagined it.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
What?
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
There...
Screamer.
We don't have a choice!
There never is.
Never been on a snowboard.
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
That's impossible.
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I'm going home.
What do you mean "you know"?
The Cowboy??
Okay, I'm thinking.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
No...I need to sleep.
Unh, unh.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
Good luck!
But I want to.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you... thank you very much.
This Denny's.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
Could be unrelated.
Interesting.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
No !
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
First Bank ? But how ?
I'm leaving.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
Okay.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here, remember ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
Knock yourself out.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
But, he's...
Trust is earned not given away.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Fire the whole division.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Yes sir.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
We can't.
Bruce has just awaken.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Zach from work ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Oh, just put it over there.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I don't even know your name.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
What do you remember about her.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Totally.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I've got something better.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
It's just a corpse.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
My mother.
I want juice!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I'd never do that.
You would.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
Uh oh...
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
In the tar??
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Big deal.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Rose this not the place to be having this...
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Oh, sure okay.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
He's so tiny.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Yes.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Okay, sure.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Are you mad at me?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Want to what?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
I love this guy! 
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
Really?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Where's Daddy?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Okay, OW!
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Don't DO that!!
I am not.
I stopped that!
What?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Bye Ma.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Not true.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Well, let's spit on it.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
Impressive.
Someday she'll thank you.
Ben Gay.
What do you suggest?
Oh, you're more than okay.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
Only.  If he wants to.
I love him.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Well, somet...
I need you.
She's too genuine.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
I got the point.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
No.  I've got you.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
It's over.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Well, it happens.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is that?
His Word.
He's going to run for president.
Third party?
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Sue was trying to get hold of you.
To the bathroom.
National?
What crook?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Sure he will.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
He is just wonderful.
Who's that?
No.
Nash.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
About three years.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
He's a member of our congregation.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
That's not quite what I had in mind.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I have to go. He sighs.
Thirty?
That's what you said before.
High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
They said go see the chaplain.
How much?
What!
Out.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
How long have you been together?
Do you study at all?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
You go to school together?
No, we never did that
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
He ain't really new.
Southern California.
I know a couple.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
You think it will?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
You got something you want to do?
Don't stop!
Who is we?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
I can appreciate that.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yes.
Yours.
She sings? What does she sing?
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Aside from the obvious?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Yes.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Next week's episode.
Yeah, sure.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Lose 'em.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Three.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You in a big hurry, boy?
Well, what d'you know?!
'That right? I thought he was up North.
People seen him 'round.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
Oh yeah?
No. I'm new in town.
In Birmingham.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Take it easy.
What d'you mean?
What d'you mean?
Four.
Okay, I guess.
How about it?
Don't push me, Duff.
Well, what d'you think?
He could live with us.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Come here, baby.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
You jivin' me?
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
What 'you signifyin'?
'Got a good thing, man.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Beat it!
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
That's right.
I guess not.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
I'll be seeing you.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's my son!
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
Why not?
And how do you suggest I do that?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Prepping your trip.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
What are you talking about?
I find out now.
Can you read my mind?
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
How are we doing?
Can you take me to it?
We got problems topside.
How long, Dixie?
How's the ice?
I don't know. I don't know...
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
It sounds like you.
Shhh...
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Hold on.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
College?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
Roger in Op/Ed.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Wings?
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
By Guy?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
They hid my car--
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
He's my teacher!
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Better person than I.
See!
I can't do this.
Why is that impossible?
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Why do you do that?
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Thanks. So do you.
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
But now you don't have to--
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I finally found my story.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Where?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Taste it.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Ken!
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Who told you to choke up that way?
Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Wow...
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Huh?
Hi, Kerry.
Did she always have nightmares?
First door up the stairs.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
To old friends.
Do you still...see each other?
Sure.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
That was different.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
Just until we get things under control.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
We're gonna try.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
For what?
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
What are you talking about?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
C'mon.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Fifteen million dollars.
Really, no.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Okay.
Let's go in.
Yes, you did.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Come in.
I have thought about you.
Well, get a message through to him too.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Thank you.  Shall I...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
And what would you say...
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Right. 
Blimey.  What's that?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Ahm... Bernie.
Yes?
Have you got a moment?
Well, fire away.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No -- did you?
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
No, 'fraid not.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Three.
Bad news.
What book?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Would you like to start?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
What for?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Shhh...
Ease up on the star drag, keep the tie up, up and work hell outta that fella.
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Are they all crazies?
What for?
Sure, Mack...
Lemme see...
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
Just warmin' up.
I refuse!
That's a dime, Martini.
A nickel.
No.
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Come an' see.
Okay. How you doing?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
Huh?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Yes, ma'am...
I thought so.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
We found each other, didn't we?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
What great aunt?
Smoking or non-smoking?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
If it's any of your business, yes.
What?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Tell me.
NO.
Oh.  That's nice.
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
No.  Are you're leaving?
I know the feeling.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
What would you call it?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Beautiful place...
Sure is.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Mommy, this is Faith.
He's a podiatrist or something.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Yes you did.
I know.  You're right.
But it's July.
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Live happily ever after.
Maybe.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Only what?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
A little bad luck?
Who said I was going?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Kate.
And we didn't have to bring another present?
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Boss loader!
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
Don't say that!
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
In braids? That's right.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
And if you don't?
But that's living like an animal—
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Terry, what's wrong?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
Edie...
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Every one of 'em... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
This is my business.
Give me that gun.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Yeah, really!
You'll work.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
I'll see you on the roof.
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
Nothing happened, Johnny.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
Be careful!--They'll see you.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
As you wish, Master
When!?
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Yes, sir, Master.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Really.  Hm.
Yes.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Shit.
I'm a tourist.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You find out?
They sure do.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
There a problem, Foley?
That's right.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
So you've done this before, huh?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Faye Dunaway.
Yes.
And your gun.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
He killed a police officer.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
You waved to me in the elevator.
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
Where?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You just did, for Christ sake.
I see better with them on.
How many?
Okay.  How many going out?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
What's to think about?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
I'm not leaving Midge.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Glenn?
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You're not my type.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
Thanks.
You a lawyer?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
The State Theater?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Off a tip?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
None I'd like to share.
It's possible.  Why?
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Likewise.
Foley's got it.
Ten gees.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Home of the brave!
There's another one!
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
From the air?
Thank you, Sir.
Respect.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
All of 'em.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Go on. You can do it.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
And nothing will ever change that.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Charlie! Am I dead?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
Why?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
What?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
I can't do that.
You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Thank God for that.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Please don't shout.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
What does Charlie think about that?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Don't eat the red ones.
Rosalie Testa!
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I don't know.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Come on. You can't be serious.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Pretty much so.
You sure did...
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
He pissed me off.
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Andy?
I said, don't worry about it.
I promise!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
I'm not going to close the--
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
They sabotaged me.
Thank you.
Not bad.
You're right.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What happens?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
No. I didn't.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
In some situations.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Right.
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
That's correct.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
... we've got a committee meeting.
Second.
Lots.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Going on... like...?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Lookit. Lookit!
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
They're coming.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Had it with deals.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Riddick? How close?
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
I would try for them.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey, me. Over here.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Like my pistola.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
How many?
Let's wait on the power cells.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
Some prophet guy?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Well, you got the big gauge.
Said "looks clear."
No. She's not.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
So which one caught your eye?
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
The blood transfusion.
It's probably wrong --
You didn't think so then.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
That way.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
He's trying to form words.
Do as I say.
long pause) You know it.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Let's take a look.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Why not?
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Where's Elias come from?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
...don't feel like it either.
...there's nobody.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Okay. You win.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Immigration Officer?
No, please.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
As I said before...
You're drinking it.
He got in here how?
Why not?
I didn't notice him.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
Including Killaine.
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Mine?
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Magruder does.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Yes.
A graduation present.
I've never been to Florida.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
I don't want to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
What will they do to you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
This way.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
Why not here?
A private joke.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
No.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
You'd be breaking the law.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
You nasty, sardonic--
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Open it and count it.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Pretty big chance, huh?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Not quiet yet.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Now, you're being beastly.
You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Yes.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Keep me company.
I'll have some of that.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Me too.
You just might.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Let me see.
Mmm...
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Why not sit down and wait?
Oh, I see.
Take a look at these.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
Darling Susan.
You're so famous now.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Where?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
My man!
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Right here, partner.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Who's our back-up on this?
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
We're not going.
What, Sergeant?
I'll take him.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You've got a lot of nerve.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Fine.
Diet coke.
Can I have some chips?
Fair enough.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Oooh, thank god.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Five full nights... days too?
Three.
Done.
Did you buy some clothes?
I think you'll approve.
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Good.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
He's good at what he does.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Where are you taking me!?
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Doing what?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Give me twenty minutes.
Have you lost your mind?
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
In Beverly Hills?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
Vivian.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
But what if they serve soup?
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Excuse me?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Then I'm here till I die?
I swear it will be done.
Should I be?
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Who's Guilder?
Veer left. Left. Left!
He's really very short on charm.
How many could you handle?
I don't think more than ten.
-- where?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Where did you get that?
Open it up.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
DEATH FIRST!!
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
Of course.
No.
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Are you a rotten liar.
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Ooooooops.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
To failure!
No way out.  No way out.
Shut up.
Really, I never dreamed ...
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Here I come, ready or not.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
Nietzche...
What do you do best?
We can't... we keep our money there!
What did you tell the people?
I told them we invaded England.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
The following morning. Sunday.
No one met her?
No! Of all...
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
With you.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
I hate tears. 
Yes.
Without calling me?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
Hospital clean.
Why not?
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I can come down next week.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Norman Bates.
I have?
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
A man should have a hobby.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I'm looking for a private island.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Why?
Please.
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
At this hour?
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Leave me alone!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Maybe you're right.
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
He isn't here.
I'm losing my blood!
Yes, the child ...
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'd love to, at any time.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Do you know George Winton?
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Excuse me???
A place you've never been.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
What?
Is Rose here?
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Okay.
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Daddy, what's the matter?
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out.
No.
She's watching the car again?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
No, son, she is dead.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Please do.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You're not having lunch?
Yes, of course.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
I am not being brutal to her!
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Yes, sir.
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Galley proof.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
You can stop it right now.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
I had better call Daddy.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
That's them trying to kill us.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
The booze.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Wha... ?
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
It's go time, Billy-B.
We have to find Kittle.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Maybe.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Oh yeah?
All for one...
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Maybe it's enough.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
I'm well aware of that.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Keep 'em busy.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
As you wish.
Wouldn't miss it.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
We got separated.
You love him, don't you?
You, too.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Red Leader standing by.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
But, why must you confront him?
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
I didn't make him for you
So come up to the Lab.
Dealing
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Ohh!
...Guess.
Why?
Could ya take off that hat.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Don't say that.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
That so.
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
He got lucky.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
Get that doctor.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Fouls.
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Where're you off to now?
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
I agree.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Black market?
Rocky, would you be interested in --
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
...What?
Come July, twenty-five.
...Who'd ya fight?
Ain't they?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
How do you mean?
Freak luck for sure.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Creed's great.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Hey --
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Help what?
Whatta you think?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
What gaps?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Apollo's a great fighter.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
So what's your next move, Valiant?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Is this paper even good?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Ask her...
What the hell's a freeway?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Doom.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
As soon as is humanly possible.
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Me.
Yeah...
Good idea.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Good-morrow, cousin.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Good heart, at what?
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Welcome.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
If my heart's dear love--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
By the hour of nine.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
And so did I.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
A most courteous exposition.
Pink for flower.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Which leads us to...
What is?
From Interpol?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
What do you mean?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
There's been a slight problem.
I take it you still want the money...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
Then where is it?
So what do we do?
A means to an end, is that it?
There is one other thing...
Really?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Who else would you be?
As in, they own it?
Something like that...
I wanted to see who you were.
Gregor's cell phone...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
But you can't.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It's my job.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
Would you stop with that...
Because I don't walk away.
I get the picture.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Sure thing, and --
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
We'll figure something out.
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
That's not what I mean.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
What are you thinking?
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
You killed him...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
My point, well...
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Two thousand...
By Friday.
Denning was wearing a bug.
No.  But he would, probably.
Hi.
Heard you had quite a night.
Nothing's wrong.
I know.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I don't know, Booth.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
I swear to you, it's true...
You know I do.
Could it have been this?
Sounds like you don't trust me.
What?
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Sort of.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well I'm here now.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Right behind you.
What?
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
At least around here it does.
Are you hungry?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
You do?
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
How'd you know?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Those girls drove off because of you.
I'm sorry.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
How you doin'?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I have plenty of dates.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
You pull a muscle or something?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
I don't want to hear this.
What?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
Take it!
It's a bomb.
Why did you help me?
Well we're not friends.
No.
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
Amen to that, brother.
Excuse me?
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
OK. Say what it is.
Carter.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
I know a shortcut.
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
Don't go there...
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stooly.
Stool pigeon.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
It happens.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
This concrete?  This is still America.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
What?!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Yes.
Griffin?  Where are you.
You have what I asked for?
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Got any last minute advice?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
You're coming here?
Why do YOU think she ran?
That must have made you proud.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
We'll see.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Really?
Six-fifty.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Excuse me?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
What!?
Yes I do!
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Ya think?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
No, I'm just going to head home.
No, you tell her.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
But it's on the water.
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
I'll wait.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Okay, okay.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I do.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
He lost all the weight... there.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Becky?
I love the symphony.
A sense of humor.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Walter and I are engaged!
We'll move them --
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
It's me?
The cabinets have to be redone --
Grace heard it.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
It is not --
Seventy... eight.
What is it?
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
What?
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
There she is.
I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
This conversation is finished.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Hi.
You could have called me --
No thanks.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
It never ends.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
No, Estellita.
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Backward.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
You weren't waiting for me.
When?
No.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
It's downright classy is what it is.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
You really need to lighten up.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Please open the door, Danny.
I need my paycheck.
You always been this stubborn?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I don't want to leave you.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
I can't tell you.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
Who is it?
My name is Tom.
Answer the fucking question!
It speaks!
Turns out he's connected.
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
They have. But they never found a lab.
You mean the menacing red car?
Really?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
I thought you were done.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
It was nothing.
Where are you from, Captain?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
Uh, Captain...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Let's just find someplace.
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
You want me to take over?
I know.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Ours is not to reason why.
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
No, sir.
Have it your way, Captain.
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.
And Sarge?
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Captain, he's fast!
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Good for her.
You're sure?
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
But you never had a first date.
Going out as friends.
That's just so embarrassing.
I'll put this past my boss
I didn't think anyone would get it.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Tell me, is it bad news?
Now why can't I tell the story?
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Yeah
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
That's cool then.
No, I'm serious.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
Okay, bye.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.  With potential.
I'm doing alright.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
This is so noble.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
It did?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
One more time would be nice.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
I'm totally and completely serious.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
What?
Hang tough, Lloyd.
How you doin', brother?
You know Diane Court?
I was gonna...
I was just going to kind of move around.
I don't know.
Alright!
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
They're not gone, they're here.
It's bad business.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
True.
He's important to my business.
These people, my people, I want my people.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Yeah, I can.
You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
There's nothing in the stores.
Things are great, things are great.
What others?
So I'll talk to him about it.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
The war could end.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
Yes.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
No, it's me.
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
I don't think that's a good idea.
You could start with an apology.
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
And are the police sure about that?
You’re all in this together?
Enter Cotton Weary.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
What's your subject?
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
Not one bit.
No way.
It's under control.
I find his work overwrought.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah?
Over here.
C'mon. Let's go.
He filmed his victims.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
No, wait...
But who would operate your camera?
Where is your attacker?
Gotta.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
Easy black boy.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
We got free tickets.
But...
What are you talking about?
Don't panic.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?!
Good bye Ben.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
What do you mean?
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
What?
Show him.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Just Jennifer.  And you.
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
None.
No really?
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
It's Sarah.
It is in my script.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
I thought you wanted me here?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
You know it.
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Yeah...
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
She looked dead. Still does.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
I'm going... I'm going.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
You know that's not true.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
What?
What?
What's that noise?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
I told you not to hang up on me.
Dial someone else, okay?
Or else what?
Sure...
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Your call.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
How is everything?
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Have you contacted the bureau?
Call the police.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Do you still think he's innocent?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
And why would she do that?
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
...so call if you need me.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
The why'd the police let him go?
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Yeah.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Thanks, Tatum.
It's past seven.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Deal.
Give it to me.
How's that?
Thank you.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
I heard.
Yeah, that's true.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
I... I don't follow.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Just wait!
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
We'll tag along.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
No.
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
I don't.  Neither do you.
It's not what you think it is.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
What happened?
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You do your job...
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
What did you say?
Really?
It's a hard place.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
He mentioned it.
I hate this city.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
I don't know.
Huh...? No...no water.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
No sir...pleasure.
Dunno...Seems so.
Got a warrant?
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
Now mount up, son...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
You were born old...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Yes, sir.
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Whatchu doin'?...
Forget it...
Cut it out, will ya...
Look?
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Over there!
We won't be here...Come on!
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
No...not yet...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Where?
But couldn't you...?
I mean the armchair!
Oh, damnit!
Yes, daddy.
Cherry-red Tears.
So do I, believe me.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
In the village.  Look what I found.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
What are you talking about-
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Yes, something was...
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Treachery!
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Romeo
And your relations?
On my mother's side the Ardens
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Cut his nose off.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
The one who came with your letter?
What do we do now?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
I will.
Be still.
Verona again.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty
And I love poetry above all.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Will Shakespeare!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it is mine too!
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
and thus unable to declare her love
Nor you for me.
My lord.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is only ours you can know.
Your aunt?
But what of Lord Wessex?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
That dog!
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
I was trying to educate you.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
Think about it.
Come on, David.
You think so?
You know what I'm talking about.
You think so?
I don't know.
How much?
There was a break-in.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
What does it look like?
Sorry to waste your time.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Now?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
No, I don't.
What are you doing here?
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
I'll wait there.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Of course.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
That's what it cost, David.
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Here.
In this firm.
Eh --
I'm not sure --
And that's why I think you fit in here.
Here?.
No.
All right.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
No. But he needs treatment.
I write about it?
The first one was fine.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Sorry?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Chicken salad.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Why?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
But you don't know what happened.
What about?
No, I know.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Am I what?
Don't make conversation with me.
No kidding.
Right, that's right.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
What's wrong?
Did you?
Did Lester know about him?
Did I what?
Yeah?
Yeah, baby...
I don't know what gets into me.
I am you, you little bastard.
He never stopped.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Don't go, Jackie...
I don't know -- I've got to.
What?
Otis is dead.
Not yet.
I have to see you.
Hey, stop by the shop.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I just... who what?
I am?
Great.
How did it go at the bank?
I already said hello.
George.
Whether or not I'm going.
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
Neither do I, baby.
A business meeting, I told you that.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
-- well aren't you --
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I'm very tired, George.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Baby, don't do this --
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
-- A wash and set.
But Mr. Norman said --
Yes it is.
When?
Oh yeah?
... this doing hair it's...
Well... who are those guys?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
I'm not anti-Establishment.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Lester, it just happened.
I'm finished with her.

Come on by.
Okay.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
What's that?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Jackie --
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
Honey?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
Good for you.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
No, it's not that...
No.
Where to, Les?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tell you things?
What about Room 237?
Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Talking to Tony.
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Delbert Grady.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
All right, sir.
Nice to meet you.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Good.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
No, nothing at all.
Yes.
Wendy give me the bat.
Wendy...
Oh, it sure would be
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
I'm intrigued.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh, I'll say.
Yes.
Stop it!
Where's Mom?
I don't get you.
Sure.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I saw what I saw.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
You bastard!
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Yes, Betty?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
Enough jabber.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You know that song?
Babies
You know?  About me?  About everything?
Five a.m.?
A cigarette?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Right.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Bless you.
It's true!
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
No food?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Really?  Lieutenant?
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Not... totally.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
That was exciting!
A Benedictine.
But where?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
You need to sleep.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
The militia?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
I did not ask you to, did I?
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
I have others.  All I need is this.
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
True enough.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Tired.
He has proposed to me twice.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You are funny.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
What are you on about?
And this gives worth to butchery?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What did you say?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
It was you there?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
His horse.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
I can show exactly.
What did you say?
May I see my mother?
She has confessed.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
Yeah, me too.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
Karl's my name.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Leave.
It went real good.
Would y'all like that?
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I know Albert. We're friends.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I aim to kill you with it.
I reckon I feel all right.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
Two people.
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
He ain't no count.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Why?
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Yeah.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
Mama?
Huh?
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
I want to come back and stay here.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I reckon.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Yes sir.
My history.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Not really to speak of.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
What about me?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Yeah.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
No! At least I don't think I am!
Better make it charge. 
And your father? Is he from New York?
American literature. What else?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
What about for you?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Yeah, I did.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
What do you mean?
But they're all the same.
He's crazy.
Uh, better make it one.
Ah-hah.
I mean, it's a good story.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Like what?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
You what?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
She looks just like you.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Why don't you open it and find out?
And you're giving it to me?
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
And these?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Just passing through.
That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Huh?
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
Of course. Where else?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
He's dead?
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
You don't really want to know.
Come on, just a little hint.
No way.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Here, catch.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Medium rare, please.
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
I said.  No further questions.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
And the last...?
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
Yes.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
I'll take two.  One for later.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
I don't think so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
I already said that, b...
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Okay, doll.
I suppose you want a tip?
Wanna see my driver's license?
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
It's entirely mutual.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
You're right, Joe.
Of course I am.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
- Type O.
You've flipped your wig!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
As far away as possible.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
Shave our legs, stupid.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
What engagement present?
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
Sugar?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Good night, honey.
Anything wrong?
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
I'm a what?
I guess she's not in here.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
I met one of them.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Oh - here and there - and around.
- you got to be blonde -
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Goodbye?
I'll throw up!
Who?
Yes, Osgood?
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
We won't breathe a word.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Then why did you take this job?
Rough?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
Not at all.
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
You're not hurt, are you?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Your view of what?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
What a beautiful fish.
What is it?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
What's on Thursdays?
Have you tried?
That makes me feel just awful.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
What else is there for me? 
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
All right - if you insist.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
Are you sure you’re okay?
What for?
Actually, I do.
Still--
Yeah.
What?
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
No, tell me.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Kat.
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Spontaneously combust?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we’ll go back to the real world and...and you’ll be hiring me for your best friend!
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Therapist.
Of course, don’t be silly.
“...but it’s getting there. “
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Is there any other way to take it?
That's right--
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
I did look, Charlie, but I--
No buts, Rita!
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir...
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
I think so...
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
You bet we is!
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight to you, son...
Come here, son...
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
What's that, son?
That's right!
Where did it come from, Mama?
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Yes, mam...
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Well, let me have it.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Whatcha wanta order?
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Yeah, just stay where you is...
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
I saw him last night!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
YOU DO?!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
The N word?
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Oh yeah.
Papa mama simi.
Baba mama!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Dude, what the hell is going on?
What's the password?
FREEZE!!
That's gonna take a long time!
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Yeah...
How do we do that?
What's the difference?
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
I thought you had something planned.
Me?!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Yes ma'am!
I'm needing lunch.
Oh God... What have I done...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Hey, come here, guy.
I am.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
He's shutting off the air!!!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
You're Warren Wayne.
Well I appreciate that.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's steady, good benefits.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
You better start making sense!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Taylor, you surprise me.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Over and out!
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
I understand.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Talk to him...Jesus...
What makes you so sure?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
I'm from Akron.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
He's my dad.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
- canker sore.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
You're a scumbag.
Clam it!
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It depends.
Someone wants to play with me?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No!
They suspended me.
What do you want with my dad?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
We'll get into that later.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Too late for what, Sheila?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
It's Junior, isn't it.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
We would have sooner or later.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Can I come with you?
Sez you!
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
What is it?
Two and a half days?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Thirty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Captain.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
You don't want to know.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Pull it.
Harry?  Can you copy?
They're coming.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
What?
The what?
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
To what?
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Yeah, why?
Beth.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Why should I go?
But I don't know how --
Still clear.
He what?
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
Squids?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
I'll just boost the doses.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
Only lab rats.  Here.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
I did do that, didn't I?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You think I manifested the snakes?
You manifested that, Beth.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
Top shelf, is it?
For whoever's in that thing.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Another attack?
Like what?  I'm not --
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Fine.  I'm fine.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Our present.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What noise?
I thought she was with you.
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
That's right.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Beth and Harry?
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
They use the Bogan Force.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Yes, sir.
As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.
Was this trip really necessary?
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Why didn't you say so before.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Not enough, I guess.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Ace of spades.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
You and me, huh ?
So ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Your turn...
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
How do I know if this is love ?
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Thank you, ma'am.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Looks like rain.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Sir, yes, sir !
Uh, no.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
The Rodger Young just burned up...
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Good for you. Go find out.
Who's that with you ?
Yes, sir !
The Creator has not answered.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
By the Creator.
Engineering...
You are what...?
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
A tractor beam...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
We're ready, sir.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Yes.
It's...
No, no, I see...
Surest thing you know.
I love your script.
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
That's for sure.
...lost the screw...
You going to ask me in?
Why?
Because I'd met someone else.
What's the scene...
I hurt you?
That's right...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Sleep well?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
...and we could get up every morning...
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I saw...
But that's what happened.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been...
I have to tell you something...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
I'm sorry.
What're you doing here...?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
...they run on water.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
Fifteen hands.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
What do you drink?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Joe, the writer?
Well.  What seems to be the...?
You have to what?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
I think he's moved...
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
I like you, too.
That's my...
No, no...Please.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
Doug...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Later for you, pal.
I...
Yes.
You should.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I know you do.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
I'm gonna nail it.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
For what cause?
I...
How do you know you saw it?
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
Why would they be illegal?
So we just got lucky.
You think so?
Ain't no second chances in life.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I hate when you say that.
Sex.  Of course.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
Good girl.
Nothing sweetheart.
Good.  That's very good.
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
That's so weak.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
Ben where do you have to get to?
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
Have you still never told him?
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
You think I didn't get that?
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
I need practice.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Anxiety.
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
You're a cross-dresser.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
How's she doing with Brad?
No.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
Feeling the pressure?
And her...?
Worked.  Like a charm.
Double.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
They don't hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Rache, it may take time.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Does Jackie know this?
There are some rumors...
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
I did not go to high school.
Who is Jesus?
He's dead.
He wasn't.
Why was he on Death Row?
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Yeah?
We have to talk.
One in a million recover.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
No.
Take off your top.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
So what's going on?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh, that's too bad.
That's too bad.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Yeah.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Times up!
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What happened!
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
I'll let the senator tell you.
Excellent.
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
Yes, of course.
At his office in the Capitol.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
A shooting war!
Yes, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
I guess so.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think we'd cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Thirty-five, still straight.
They must have made a visual contact.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Primary trigger switch.
First safety.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
What happened?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Then get off my back!
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Typical male.
You didn't get me in trouble.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Yeah.
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
No, no.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
A long, long, long...
So you can do an album cover?
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look.
Alright, Pony!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
You better! Yes!
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
It's okay.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
No, no, whoa!
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, wow.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Nobody. Sooze.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Will you just put the gun down?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay, so maybe later.
Your sure as hell right about that.
Like what?
But do you stand for anything?
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Tim!
Yeah.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Where are you going?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, fuck it, man!
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
You know what I'm saying?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Mine too.
You done?
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Really? What else does your mother say?
Oh, How'd she get back?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Just one?
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Oh that's nice for you.
The fuck not?
Fuck.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
And they get caught!
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
Oh, Jack...
Trix...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
He Ikea'd us.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Don't use big bills!
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
You damn well better...
My what?
Now how the hell can I help you?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Roll 'em.
Close, but no cigar.
What's wrong with it?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Well....
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
Check.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
If you please.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
You bet.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
You're a writer, you said.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
What scene?
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
"Mad about the boy."
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
I ran into some people I knew.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Wanted what?
Madame is waiting.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
The doctor suggested it.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
Right with you.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Frankly, no.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But what will happen?
Eliminate her.
Am I? Still?
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
It's for your own protection.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
We're from different worlds.
Let me kiss you.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Well...I guess one is all right.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
She'll forget about us eventually.
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
I did.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I could force you.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
What about my proposal?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, sure.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
I'm Linda Lee.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
What? Me?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Clark.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Oh...I came close once.
Me neither...
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Anyday...
We get together sometimes.
Say!
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Yeah.
Dishwasher? Any luck?

Or socks.
Columbia.
What?
Just the man I wanted to see!
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Everything.
Tell me more...
No...I just have a little stop to make.
What about me?
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Where's the handle?
Missing????
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
I do?
Actually, yes.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You do?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
North!
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
I asked the right question.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
And I will lead.
We must combine our strength.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
If you say so. Here goes.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Our other dinner guest.
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Bunkers!
He's thirty-five years old.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Albert!
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
I just took a shot at it.
Come again?
It wasn't a trick!
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
He's from another world.
You're on.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I read the article.
Bingo!
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
La de da da...
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
Then -
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Say hi to Zoe.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
They just finished supper.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
No.  It should be dry by now.
That's because he misses you.
It's natural.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
When?
People who will help our cause.
Indian?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Who did they get for that?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You remember this?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
But you didn't lose me.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?
Hitler!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
I only had a few hours.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Why?
Who said Sidney?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Not just this minute, J.J....
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Can't hurt...
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
I'm used to you...
I know you do, Sidney.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
I didn't do anything!
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Can I stop by my house?
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
You will.
Drive faster.
Trust me.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
And no elbows on the table!
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
You do shorthand and typing?
Three months.
What's in those files?
What is this, Emmi?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Who?
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
No!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Show you?
Do it, Helmuth.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
He did?
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
His private life?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Come to the office, please.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
The what?
You like it?  It's my first.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
I want it to be over for you.
Not possible.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I put a cigarette out in it.
Call her.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
Where are you going?
Why not?
They'll love that.
You're the one who started running.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
The maitre d' called you Christine.
It's okay, dad.
Come here...
Who the fuck cares?
What do we do?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Guess you missed it.
I saw them kill him!
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Claire.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Guess!
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
The key?
Is there a room key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
I'm not sure.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
The Hinchberger wedding.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Friend... why don't you back off.
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Attempted murder.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I've read your tests.
No.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
-- how much is this car worth?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
Mary came with me.
Nell, what do we do?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Why?
Fifteen dollars.
No.  The world has missed you.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Red.  What else?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
-- but the painting!
I do.
Then what good is he?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
What kind of food?
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
Come over here.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
It was better than a telegram.
This ain't your lot?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Not me, man.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Uh-huh.
No, but I know what he means.
You look alike.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Not ashamed.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
I might've been away for the weekend.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
I see.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
I don't believe it.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
No rest for the wicked.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
Walked.
Ann. Will you come in?
Ann--
Yeah. Thanks.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
That's what he keeps telling me.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
It's OK...
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
Ed.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Dave.
You don't have to--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...I don't think so.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
So--
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Uh-huh.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Great.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
Where's the head?
Unfortunately, no.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
Oh shit.
All right everybody, hold up!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
I don't believe it.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
I'm not giving up.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
I think so.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Yes.
I don't believe it.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Big as a house.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
What?
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
Wounded?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
Vince!
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I have to shoot.
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
Why wouldn't I?
Do it!
Thank you.
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I can't tonight.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
What?!
You hate gambling.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Well, I made it through another night.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
It looks so small.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
You can count on it.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Penetration but not perforation.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Working with?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Into what?
Old friend of your father's.
Who sent you?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
I'm not sure. A virus --
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Did you find something?
You're looking for a bomb.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Get dressed, Scully.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
I can't really talk right now.
What kind of infection?
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
What did you find?
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Come on!
I need you on this, Scully --
No -- it's --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Well, call General McAddie.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
Is she alive?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
I do it all the time!
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
Peter, okay?
I did, yeah.
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Then what is he?
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
It doesn't matter...
No problem.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
That hoist, with the winch...
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Give her some cigarettes.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Were you at the inquest?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Yes.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
Me.
I'm sorry.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
And my passport?
Two weeks ago.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
They'll be returned, miss.
I don't want it.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Where?
Fellow called Lime.
Schmolka!
Once in a while.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
What?
Him dying like that.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
This is where he vanished.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Take him to Sacher's.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What do you want?
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
Vinkel.
Thank you.
Not necessarily.
English?
Yes, yes, I remember you.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Suppose I take...
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not when I get interested.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
Two.
We swim.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
It's just the sky, Richard.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
He's an asshole.
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Is he a Nazi?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
No.
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Oh, yeah... 
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
What assholes.
It looks a little like a swastika.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
What's it about?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Nothing. Let's go....
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
Danny, what about the Jews?
What??!?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Why?
Those aren't Jews.
How do you reconcile the two?
Explain it so I can.
It was a nine millimeter.
I don't do that.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
You said they didn't have night guards.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
"Do chickens give milk?"
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Of course.
I said that the file is incomplete.
... So am I.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Congratulations.
What was he like, when he was little?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Congratulations, Enzo.
You know what I'm talking about.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Why?
Dollars.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
And... does the voice come back?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
It's too loud for me.
I'd better get back now.
Why?
Then, tell me a story.
You sure?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
No.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Well... here.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
How was your trip?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Then, goodbye.
I said, do you come here often!?
Yes Esther.
Oh. Okay.
Mordechai!
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Why not?
Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
Mmm———yes.
You get your money from your husband.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
The elderly man I told you about.
Good evening.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
More or less.
About Charlie's leopard?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
It's better you don't know.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was a calamity!
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Why?
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
Get it out of here!
You're too good to me.
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
Will you please come with me?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
And that is the last time any...
Can it be that easy?
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Who is Friedman?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Paul Lamont...?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon could still have hung himself.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Good.
You bastard...
You splendid bastard...
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Yeah.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Yes... Good, good...
How much of a hurry are you in?
What...?
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
And who does Friedman work for?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Yes. How did...
Must I speak to you in French?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Don’t jump any red lights.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
What are you talking about?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon’s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Is she on the phone?
Three days and that’s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, I’ll stay in mine. So long, Mister.
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
I know his work better than I know him.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
10,000 gold crowns.
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Better today than tomorrow.
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
What... what do you mean?
Not yet!
I want to stay with you...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I -- I don't understand...
Sound the retreat...
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
And?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
And God who allowed you to be caught?
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
I'll be right here... I promise.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Yes.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
He's feeling wonderful.
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
Noooo!
If there was, I didn't see it...
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Not yet.
I... submit to Our Lord.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
No...!
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Not for long...
If you kill him, you kill me!
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why would they?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I agree...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
What for?
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes...
Let's see.
But you already confessed this morning...
Whose were they?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
What... does he... look like?
Really?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
I haven't seen him.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
Who told you?
You know what we do? We use psychology.
You're out, aren't you?
I can look after myself!
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
Stop it, Wladek.
No, I don't think so?
Show me.
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
Ohhh I've never been there. 
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Yes, I thought that.
You mean in signs?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
He chopped it off
A piano?
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
Here.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Shove off, Duff.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
I like griftin'.
Forget it.
Who's got the contract?
I can talk, can't I?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I picked something up on the way.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
If we ever get to it.
Yeh, it was easy.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
What are the odds on Syphon?
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
2:00 A.M.
What the hell for?
You move right along, don't ya.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
You're a lucky man, all right.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
You better take a drink.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Don't cry.
Go!
Go away!
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
There!
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
I don't know.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Yes... yes.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
know.  But I saw him -
What's that to you?
Keep on asking.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Trail him!  Trail who?
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
No.
Let him have his say out.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Why, you said...
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I never had it.
Yes?
I trust you.
No.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Six Martinis.
Yes.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Well, didn't you?
Your guess is as good as mine.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Goodbye, darling.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
How did you get in here?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
You did.
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Break it out.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
We can't just go off and--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Move!
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
He's an enemy soldier.
We're at war.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
What if I do?
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
Wh-what do you think--
They're not going to--
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
...I know.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Just relax.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What are they doing here?
They can't shoot us in here.
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
He's not going to leave us.
Jesus, Jaeger.
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll lie.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I don't want to die.
Just let me rest for a second.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
I don't have a weapon.
Why haven't they killed us!?
We go this way.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
Too low.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't be so sure.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
Don't let them separate us.
It's the end.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
...and you're not lost now?
What have you done, Cut your hand?
All right...
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Yep.
Why do you do it?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
What's wrong?
Oh shit...
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Taylor's dead.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
Look, it's important.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Quiet!
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I thought I told you--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
<u>Niente!</u>
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
I know it!
M'sieu Monescu!
Why should you?
Thank you.
Gaston Monescu.
But it's not enough!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
But, Lily--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
How do you like my dress?
Lipstick?
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
But it could have been glorious.
What is it, madame?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Didn't you take it with you?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
You're certain?
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Not the better half.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Bollocks.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
You're welcome. Rose.
If only it were that simple.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
Sssshh. Come here.
This is crazy.
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
I promise.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Not at all.
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Sure!  Excuse me.
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
You work too fast for me, young man.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Sorry.
Sally--!
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You can live that down, can't you?
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
I'll take one. 
It's a pleasure.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Thanks. That makes us square.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
I should say not.
Yes--Me--in person!
I thought I put you to bed.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
You can't bluff me any more.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
"Smooth's" the word.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Isn't that a daisy?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Not now.  I don't have time.
Beauty, ain't he?
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
But who was the Devil?
In vino veritas.
Sorry, sorry...
Revenge?  For what?
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
I know what it means.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Just answer.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
I hate Sadie.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Forget it, Ringo.
Not anymore, not after this.
Drop his horse.
I'll be damned...
Yeah?
What're you talkin' about?
Sure...
But she doted on the frowner
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
I'm on my way.
I see.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
- We all want what we can't have?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
Do you?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Fishing?
Does it work on cash machines?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Step into my office.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
He tied one on.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Depends what number you write.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No?
- You're not.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
He was my father's best friend!
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
I didn't say when I want to die -
Yes, M.
I understand.
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
I am. What do you want?
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
What's wrong?
No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
My timing always was lousy.
Excellent.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Will the cruise set it off?
Yes.
You always got something to say.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Hush.
Just stay in bed and rest.
What happened to your hand?
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
That's nice.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
My mother passed on years ago.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Don't shout!
I'm sorry he got those birds.
No, I haven't seen him.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
No.
Sorry.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Woody!
The match!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Look!  Janie!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Last present!
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Uh-oh.
What?!
Bad news?!
I did like the music.
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
She got away.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
What did I do wrong?
Finn -
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
I can't find Manolo.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
You will believe me, because it's true.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Why?
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
She asked me not to.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Not yet.
Hi.
Helena --
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
I don't know.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
We're playing!
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
No.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
Only if he can be trusted.
It could mean that, yes.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Agents who died in the field.
I'm sorry.
Ninteen.
Diane.
It's where I live.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Sorry.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Sixteen next month.
What happened?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
And you might get the fucking job.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
Running time?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
No, I don't think so.
Excellent.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Six weeks.
Six weeks!
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
My pain?
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
MM.?
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Why?
Damn.  Let's go.
Yes, Captain?
If you think it would help.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
How do you know?
Is what possible?
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
No special conditions?

I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I belong here.
I don't understand...
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Hi, Flynn.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
I'm sorry -
It can be arranged...
Where did you hear that name?
Yeah, I... oops!
Stranger and stranger...
Not us, I hope.
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
It's something Users do.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Out.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
In the helicopter.
Will you just open the door!					*
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
Put a tap on her phone.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
You're welcome.
Is that why you got into this business?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Sure.  Say that now.
Uh huh.
Louder please.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
You wouldn't believe me.
Are we going to die?
I don't take those assignments.
What?
And you've got one.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What about the husbands?
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
And you chased one?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Ya looked through it?
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
At the movies?
Uh-huh.
"Heroes For Sale"?
A real live pimp?
What did he do to Arlene?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Heard that.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
She's with me.
It's great to hear from you.
Every word of it.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
What's to think about?
In case.
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Really?
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Why does he trust you?
I can, but I don't.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Do you still have friends on the force?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
On their honeymoon.
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
Pussy love pink rocks.
- Because it's good!
No.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
You're right. It is.
I didn't mean -
Donowitz, he said.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
I have to go.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
...I had a dream about...something like that.
I...I...We need cash, James.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
I'm not crazy.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... "weird" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
He's been tested for drugs?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
That's my morning's pay.
Will be.
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
I don't know your real name.
No trouble at all, really.
I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
What?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Did you ever?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Where are you going?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
He was going to take the money.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Where the hell am I going to go?
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
I'm her husband.
John Stewart.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hungry?
I did?
And tell her what?
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
All I have in the world.
Trouble with the car again?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
That's a thick change of heart.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Come on, Jake--
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
She's dead.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
What happened?
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
I didn't do anything.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Senor, you need a doctor.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
...And everything is nothing too.
Who's cursed?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
You afraid of the dark?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm her husband.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Grace, tell him.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
An overheated car.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
I do.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
That's a bit much.
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What's your name anyway?
Get away from me!
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
You've been there?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
What sign?
That's right on my way.
Thank you.
Where'd you learn to do that?
And what would that be?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
I don't know how.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Don't feel like nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Try me.
I'm sorry...
Yeah.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I could if I had Jake's money.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
My mother died in this canyon.
'Cause I love you.
"Arkady"
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
One way.
Genuine Draft?
Sure, I'll try.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Is Noel in?
No.
What did I say?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
We've already begun.
Are you for real?
You thought he was carrying a knife?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
How much can you lift?
No Jeremy.
Know what?
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Shit and fried eggs.
Oh.
Be careful with those, sonny.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
That much, huh?
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
But he was called...
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
N-no, sir?
About what?
What for?
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
Yeah?
You better get on back, Miss.
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Well, she...
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Yeah.
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
He's dead, Bill.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Two.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Nothin's bent.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
See that scrub oak yonder?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
Maybe.
There's more.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
You are a criminal.
Dig.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.

Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Tell him we'll meet.
Two hours, tops.
Waste of time.
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
He loved her.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
What call?
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
Wait a minute.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
That's right.
Well, we...
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
No.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
I...yes.
I thought I would need it.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Hold on a second.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
You're going to settle out of court?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
That's what I am.
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
No.
I don't have a goddamned idea.
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
No.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Oh shit, what's today?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
That's right.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What difference can that make...? All right...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
It's locked.
... You saw her?
What did she say?
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
We, we were rather busy...
What happened in those three...
What happened in those three minutes...?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No, I'm all right.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
From whom?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Honest?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Well, after all, it's "our place."
How does it work?
No! Let me go!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
My name is John Ferguson.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
What?
No! No, thank you!
What?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Why?
Madeleine!
Would you know the room?
Where?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
I'm here, I've got you...
Why? What's happened?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Yes.
Please let me go.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I won't lose you.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
What's tomorrow?
How do you know? Personal experience?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
That's following a train of thought.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
How?
Where?
Did you need it?
Yeah.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
Well that's what I said.
Name one.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
I'm not getting a ticket.
What?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
We can't do this.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
I got children. I've got a life.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
There's more.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
She's still working?
Who's up for making some real money?
Shut up.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He's having a problem here.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
Take care of business.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell you didn't!
You hate women.
True.
I love you.
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
What?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I think so.
Are we going to do this again?
Well it's bad timing.
He is.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Who else?
Why? What's his problem?
I've seen it on television.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
I need your help.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Have a nice bachelor party.
Not yet.
What okay?
What!
I'm working on it.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
What?
Who's dead?
Micheal, by accident.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
Like how?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
About what?
So?
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
What?
Did she believe you?
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
Downstairs in the closet.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
What's the matter?
But what can I say to her, sir?
She won't even know.
That's fifteen by seven?
That's it.
That's good land.
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Why the bad temper?
That your cousin is more to your taste.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Why?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
A black bull came.
I had so many things to think about!
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
From the terrace.
Catch him and your record's clean.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I don't know.
I wish we could hear them.
He was a computer program for crissake.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Fine —— you want to stay here?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
What did you find out?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Separate the character module from the neural net...
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Then fix it.
Should I have?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
A little less than yesterday.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Go to hell.
What you need is a collar.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
This is my area of expertise.
Start of what?
Both.
That, or living through him...
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
What if he's busy tonight?
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Wilfred, that's not bad.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
All I need is the one day.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
I'm working on it.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
The American "people"?
...but...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
...I just hope...
...this's <u>good</u>...
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
The War is Over.
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
...what are we going to do...?
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Quite touching.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
...Yes.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
...that's what it is.
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
What do we have that they want?
"Freedom."
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
W...what?
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
All the greater accomplishment.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
You've <u>got</u> something, there...
...givem what they want...But...
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Get on your feet, boy.
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
...but...
Deal's changed.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Yes.
Why a beret?
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
a "pond," or
...if I had your looks, better.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Sell?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Don't start, alright.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
I don't know anything!
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
He never told me...
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
Oh no, no...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
You're learning, sport...
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
What makes you think you can?
Why do you need to wreck this company?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
Why?
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Allow me sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Big deal!
China
Go away.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
I'll come back all the time.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Fine.
What do you think?  Guess.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
You know where she is?
I don't know.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
M-E...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Something was there.  You saw it.
If she was dangerous before--
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Fine.
You know what I mean.
You are...
I'll be there.
Why?
I know.
Really?
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Then where is she?
Yep.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
But I don't remember.
What's wrong with me?
Stop...
Claire--
Oh God...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Do you know it?
You don't have to do that.
Shhhh.
:Would you stop it!
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Michael, Rowan should -
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
He made that quite clear, yes.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
Who is this...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
There are things I have to know!
Eighty million doll --- ?
The lamplight.  That's all.
Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
uh - then he - be just -
To love, you must be able to feel.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
All I meant was -
What's wrong..?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Mm-hmmm...
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
- we made a fire.
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
Gotcha.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
He's got great hands.
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Did you?
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
What was I supposed to do?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Well, Dad said...
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We reinvented ourselves.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
But that smile.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We own a small family grocery store.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
We love our lives just the way they are.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It's my private business! Mine!
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Yeah.
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Most places are, Jimmy.
My room?
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
To the best hiding place in the world.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
Let your fingers do the walking.
You better.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
I'll make you very proud.
I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You're sure?
I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
That's perfect.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I'm just a messenger.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He was large?
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
The skinny brunette.
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
Where's this coming from?
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Just tell us what happened.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Lombardo ever come out here?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You can trust me.
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Police -- God -- get a life.
I'm not on your property!
Whichever one I want.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Where, the mall?
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
We have to stick with the plan.
Why can't you come...
You know what it takes.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Story's the same, Detective...
Yes.
And she wanted to talk.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
We?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Funny.  So am I.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
Hey, I tried the board.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
In the next two minutes?
What is this?  A whole new train?
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Your guests, ma'am?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Yes sir.
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Not today, Willow.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
No.  I mean yes.
Why not?
You're not a woman.
Say what?
As above, so below.
Why.
Farmer.
I will.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Me neither!
Here.  Hold her.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Good, you start tomorrow.
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Oh sure, Fred.
John, why?...
...I want to say a thing.
What are you going to do?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Just us.
Move! Or you die right here!
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
I would not be too sure.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Home.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
No. I'd want a public phone.
Oh. The bullets.
A real fireball.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
You're so sure of that?
That's your way, not mine.
Here. Whenever you want them.
Listen to me – Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I'm coming.
Say again?
Probably.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Lean on him.
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Oh -- all right.
Yes, darling.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Is morally, ethic'ly
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Do you presume to criticize the....
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Me?
Oh...
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh-oh-
The nerve.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Ohh!
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Oh, you did it yourself!
Fine.  He's got a plan
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Hold still - hold still --
Whozat?
I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
No, sir!
We do.
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
You know something?
Well, that's you all over.
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Well, I --
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Elektra King.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
I took the initiative.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Who?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Who did you get it from?
Indeed.
Yes.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Shush.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Washington?
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Hello, Adrian.
Collect me?
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
What if you¹re wrong??
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Memory lane.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
The costumes.  Am I right?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Everything's changed --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
What about you?
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Maybe I'll do that.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
What is this place?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Is that a fact?
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
We're not after car thieves here.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
He gets to be the hero.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
That right? Why's that?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Aren't you afraid?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
When else are you gonna do it?
Of course.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
We all do.
I wanted to talk to you.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
What if they're naughty?
Yeah, I'll bet you have.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
What did she do to me?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Poppycock!
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
I suppose you're right.
It seems fine.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Why did you do that?
Yes, sir.
One week at the most!?
I beg your pardon?
Vermicelli.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
Fron kon steen!
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
I see.
No.
What wockers?
The wockers with the knockers.
What?
Must be the music room.
Why?
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
This guy means business.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
I'm not trying to be funny.
... I'm glad that's...
How do you know it was a 'he'?
What???
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
But who was playing it?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
What do you think we should do?
This is not the finals -- just sing!
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
I see what you mean.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
