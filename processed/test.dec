The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Let's go.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like you care.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
In 9th.  For a month
Why didn't you tell me?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Perm?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
I thought you hated those people.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
You and Verona?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
You don't care if I die
Why?
You know what they say
What?
Hearsay.
You know what I mean
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
I didn't care about the money.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Yeah.  I guess.
Yeah.
Make anyone cry today?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Chief says -- he has a God.
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Six days ago, yes.
You tell that to them!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
No.  No way.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
So...the station is empty?
So you were never a prostitute?
I know.
They're not gonna send you right back.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Right.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was that, Korfin?
Vodka tonic.
Any I.D.?
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
No.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah, why should you?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Stay here.
Better than one.
Raw deal.
You know what I'm saying here.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Answer the phone.
Yeah.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Not what.  Who.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
No.  Are you proposing?
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Yes.  Both.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Cut!
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
We started over, you can too.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
In love?  With who?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Well, he killed my partner!
I used an accelerant.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You hear that question, Garcia?
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Right. Just a sec.
Oh?
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I guess it isn't.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Thank you very much, Hal.
Opening pod bay doors.
I want to pick up my car.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
You stay with me...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.
One of  em's in the slam.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Tell me.
Can't complain.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
At your service.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I'm saying.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Like shit.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Hi Ma...
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Does it get any better or what!
Where have I heard this song before?
Why not?
Uh..you're welcome.
I'm so tired...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Uh..
...What do you mean?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Amen..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Okay, I believe you.
I know.
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
I'm telling you...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What?
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
I'm asking.
You'll get it when we get there.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I'll risk it.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Max.
Interesting theory.
Snuff films.
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
Good question.
Where does he sell it?
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
See ya.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm here.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
No.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Cash.
Okay.  Fine.
Kristen...
Then we'll stay up together.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
Nice neighborhood.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
Been having bad dreams.
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
You're right.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Now.
No, the Dan part was nice...
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Meaning?
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
But if they <u>do</u>?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
'Us?'
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
I...don't know!
Something wrong?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Wonderful!
Under <u>water</u>?
What direction does the system indicate?
Huh?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
- for horrors like yourself?
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
How soon?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
This way.
How'd you get the job?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Break stuff?
What then?
Yes.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Huh?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Something bugging you?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Where's Jill?
Hi honey.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
But not now.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
It's nice.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
The other guy.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Huh?
Yeah, I guess.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Don't you even want to ask?
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
I'm doing what I can.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Ga get it.
How many others killed?
Nine.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Hold on, Alice.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Where's my family?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Yeah, right.
I just wish it was that simple.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
There's nothing wrong with me!
If that's the way you want it.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Yes, sir.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right.  Here.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Well...not for another two hours.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Show me.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Nothing.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
But I-- .
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Stop the car!
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
You must leave me alone on this.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
For you, anything.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Did he find anything?
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Don't tell me what to think.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Can't lock up...
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
How long until it blows?
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Now, wait a second --
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Shut up.  Just shut up!
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
...We're coming in.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
Don't be long, Ellen.
You're just reading me.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
No.. I've slept enough.
Why do they tell little kids that?
That's right.
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Good morning.
How do you know?
What's that?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Where?
What are you talking about?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Wolfi!
What does she want?
I don't know.
Oh, damn!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Not at all.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Hey!
Behold!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Why not?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Well, look at them.
What? On one hearing only?
What do you mean, Sire?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Ah, love again.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
Don't you have a maid?
This one will.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Good morning, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sssh! Stay here.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
But this is absurd!
Do you have a daughter?
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
A Mass for the dead.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Consigned to flames of woe.
What?
Oh, yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
I think so.
Show me.
I think you'd better.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Who is on this committee?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
In the sight of God that is a sin.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Is it true?
You cannot say that!
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
He's setting that play to music?
Where?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Ah.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Yes, I believe he did.
Yes.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
David?
I dream of death mostly.
Twenty-eight.
Yes, go on.
What?
I was dreaming again?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
I've left those pills for you.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I swear, I don't know this girl.
No.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No. You've had your chance.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Nice to see you.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
You ask them.
Wrong.
You ask them.
Apparently so.
No, but he was on the moors.
Yeah.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
I'll tell you when we get there.
What?!
I'm not listening!
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You look awful.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
I beg your pardon?
Charlie!
Aw, nerts!
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
We'll discuss that in the board room.
That's very simple. I was home.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Yes, now.
Thank you!
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Oh, ten dollars—
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes, why?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Yes, sir.
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
How?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Leave me alone, Bob.
I ain't done --
Oh no...
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Twenty?!
A trap.
You ride like a Comanche.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Bob's upset.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
If I could go back to farming --
Yeah.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
You didn't want to farm?
Not if I find the right girl.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Last February?
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Really?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
What is that?
I remember you.
It's going to be a long winter.
No.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Courtney? Dinner?
Pick me up?
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
That's nice.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I don't think so.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Yes, darling?
But what about the past? Our past?
You're inhuman.
There was no ad in the Times.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
This.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why would I?
No.
Does he do this all the time?
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No, I'm okay.
It's no problem
Shoot.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
No problem. 
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
No.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
What?
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
And?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
Al.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Milo! What about --?
Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
...Why?
I remember.
Milo --
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Prick.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I am. I am, sir.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Yes sir.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Outpost doesn't own em.
We could move 'em up here.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Right... Right.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Just thought his work should go on.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Keep looking.
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Hmm?
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
What?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Gary.
Oh.
What?
Is that how Larry feels?
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What does that mean?
I didn't plan this.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Care for some saki?
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Oh, and Austin...
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Carnies.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Yes Basil?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Here, use mine.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Who?
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Not now, Austin.
Is it one of ours?
Silence!
Yes.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Dr. Evil?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Not me.
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I love you, Vanessa.
We don't judge here.
... bottle ...
There, look!
Then you can't come in.
We have met ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
Next assignment?
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Rules are made to be broken.
Do you really think so?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
You mean my other self ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Orders.
To kill me?
Because you always obey orders ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You lied.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
It's called Black Leather.
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Where are you going?
Still a bit chilly ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Dead, I'm afraid.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
She may try to kill you.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
I think so, thank you so much ...
Both, actually.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
That's not playing by the rules.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Check out the other guy's buns.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
When do the girls get to the party?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
What is this person's story here?
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
Sure have...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Yes, sir.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Good...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Let's get naked.
You're on.
Let's see your bread.
Yes.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Milt?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Oh, no!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Olivier's in that, right?
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
No.  I need a drink.
We're gonna be okay, man...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It works.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- Never mind.
This?
Thanks for the insight.
Just leave me alone, okay?
-- What are you doing here?
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Got anything to drink in there?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Then why did you quit?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Just take it.
You're right.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Then who --
Trychticholorate.
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Just wondering.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Management were pin heads.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I'm busy.
They're waitin' man.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Tell him about me, Shadow?
"The Strawberries"?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Manray needs a job.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
And this is Manray.
We're starving.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Go on.  Good so far.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
Where do you go from here?
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Do you know how you will use him?
What point is that?
You getting cold feet?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
I thought it was appropiate.
That's why it will be so much fun.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Not at all?
What's a Negro.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
I thought you got rid of...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...I heard different, thought that was...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
The good stuff.
Just a little something' somethin'.
No, before my time.
We can look out for ourselves.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
That is none of your business.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
I have acted as I think fit.
And his baggage?
And so I am.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I have heard of them.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
I have faced that problem before.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
That is a trifle strong.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Papa?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
I beg your pardon?
And he doesn't care about me?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Who?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
He's lying.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Would you have believed me?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
If not you, then who?
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Then who did?
No. I said Dunbar.
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
And the problem is you only got three.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
What the hell are you talking about --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Not for long.
You're crazy --
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Why?
Excuse me?
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Something like that. You?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Let's go talk to Bill...
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
I should probably write that down.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
That would explain the indigestion.
There's only one I want.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
I don't expect to.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
Please?
I never knew.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
Karl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Go out with me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
Did you?
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
So you never bought any land.
Yes. Thank you.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Thank you.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Yes.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
In the world.
It's none of your business.
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
He will come back.
Why not?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Sometimes.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You...
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
It's alright.
No. I think I better just go.
Maybe you will find out.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You go to hell.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
And you gonna live it with him?
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
I said... STOP!
Uh-uh.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Anything.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You can handle it.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Ain't gonna be moved?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
I do.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Rae don't do this now...
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
What?
Ronnie...
Yeah.
You need money again?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
No.
Let's grab some food.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
A snitch?
Ichiro --
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
Not without a small army, Nicklaus- san.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
I can't...
Kampai.
Luck.
Yes...
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
I don't think so.
He's on duty.
And I'm supposed to care?
I don't remember you saying no.
I'd like that.
Why me?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
This afternoon.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Tomorrow, he says.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Who.
Your customer, eh?
Day after tomorrow.
Okay, but...
I know all that.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Sorry, don't have the time.
I don't know.
Four years.
Yes?
What did she want?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
Are you for real?
I'd kill it.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Sit.
Yeah.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Know what a turtle is?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
Hi.
I don't have one.
Come where?
Young man, stop right there!
What?!
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Yes, I'm right?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Two weeks.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
I don't want to be alone.
What?!
Uh...yeah.
That's boring!
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
No it's not!
And don't be so obvious!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
What?
Yes, Eve?
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Yes.
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Then why go there?
...the pipe tobacco.
Uh-huh.
Really?  Since when?
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Yeah.
True.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How old are you?
Gladly.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yes, ma'am.
You're my brave boy.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Thirty -five years!
To go up.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
If I...you know...
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You bet.
I thought ten years.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Well, that's blunt!
I think...it...works.
Eve?!
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Those sluts!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Where did he get all that information?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Stand by. One.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Roger, Wolf One.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes.
No.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Yeah, hurry up though.
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes. Frank--
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Come on Dorothy.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Frank?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Okay Frank.
Good, let's drink up.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yes.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Brilliant.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
What is it?
No Jeffrey!!
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Go find one.
Aye.
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Ma, what's wrong?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
BLAME...
Shut it. It's Ma.
Okay. We're ready.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
No pictures, either.
A bit.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Yeah?
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
Three.
The fat man.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
No. You sure you're okay?
You sure you killed them?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
I guess not.
Yes.
No. They would never do that.
Have you no fear of God?
Just be natural, goddamit.
Yeah boss?
He's a nigger.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Dignan, it's --
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Would they do that?
Yeah.
Dignan! Stop!
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Inez, this is --
Sure.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Where's the rest?
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
What is it?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
I did.
Did that hurt?
As a person?
Yes. I do.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I don't know.
There's not enough time.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
The grandfather clock?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
It's an esoteric journey.
Absolutely.
Hector woudn't do anything.
I hope not.
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
It was stupid.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Like silk?
You're Anthony?
Uh-uh.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
True.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Maybe she turned.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
His name was Swifty?
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
They said he's a drug dealer.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Come on, Dignan.
Not in that car you're not.
I know it's not.
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Look. We want you on the job.
He's stuck between two floors.
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
You got that?
Sure.
Nice to meet you.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Then what?
You killed them.
I'm sorry.
Conklin.
No. There's nothing new.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Tell me later.
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
Are you disappointed?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
What?
Here?
Now. Show now.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
Still...
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
Are we locked up?
Are we hacking or asking?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
He was a modest man.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
How many?
Aye, we'll get 'em.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Humbly, M'lord.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
...I wouldn't know.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
And I will consult with mine.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
And the bad news?
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
Cute, Evan.
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Duck, here they come.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What do you mean?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Different? How?
Yeah?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Kayleigh? What happened?
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
Who -- who are you?
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Been there, done that.
Hey, I got no choice.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I should have known.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Well?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Monsieur Rick!
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Come up here a minute.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I'm awfully sorry.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
And I was wondering.
Why there is no other man in my life?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I didn't count the days.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Yes, ma'am.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Be careful.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
No, Victor, there isn't.
Of course, I'll be careful.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
What of it?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Here it is.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
We'll be there.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
What else, my dear Major?
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
And if it should change?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
What, again?
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You think of everything, don't you?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Will I see you tonight?
Sacha, she's had enough.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Not right now.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
You've had today's water.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
As much as anybody.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Well, I do a little drawing --
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
I had it on the island with me.
Must be a story there.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You have any children?
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
You fucked us over.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
We're on.
You're fucking dead!
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
That's all there is.
San Francisco.  And you?
I was!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Oh, sure!
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Right.
It will be okay.
He's *paralyzed*!
Sure. Thanks.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I can't go nowhere.
You mean somebody asked?
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Someone not from Maine.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Actually, I volunteered.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Okay...
You still doin' it too fast!
Is it true?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
Yes, for both.
It looks like scurvy.
Obviously.
I haven't read that.
I don't think so.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I don't need your gratitude.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Almost.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
What view?
I told him that you all is sick.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Tough day?
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
It's not true.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
We're going to give him the money back?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Two million.
Minus one.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
And some new clothes.
You're just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
Did I miss something?
WHAT?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
What about what?
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
Can't say.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
Maybe another time.
Goodnight.
I can imagine.
What?!
All right. As what?
I'm working on that soccer story.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
I've got something to tell you.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Are you drunk?
I'm on at nine.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
You will?
Gambling's not about money.
Then what?
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
You know where I'm from?
Well, thank you anyway.
There's a casino in this hotel.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Turn left at the lights.
Over the river.
Nice car.
How long have you worked at the casino?
You've done pretty well.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
I said good call.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
He's a good customer.
What flickering light?
-- open quantum latches --
Energy shielding positive function.
Thanks.
Of course.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
That is correct.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Doolittle...
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What was that, Doolittle?
It didn't work?
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
This.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
It's a rule.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
I don't want to move away.
When?
Girl's gotta make a living.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
The one you're wearing?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Bent?
That would be appropriate, yes.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
What's in it for you?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
None.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I actually know how this works.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Does this person have a name?
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
No, I mean... you love your son?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
Yeah.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
A metal craft of any kind.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Sure.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Why?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
Maybe she's asleep.
Where is she?
When did you stop taking your medication?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
He said to follow him.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
I think about girls a lot.
Who is the boss?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Is Callie still around?
I... I was playing with fire.
That I did it again.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Why would I tell Mom?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Congratulations.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're not a bitch.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
I guess they made him do it.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Beg pardon?
But now you can't go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Kitty...
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Really, Loretta?
I gotta work with these women.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
I'll be right back. See ya later.
I got a hairdo.
Dakota.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Gladys! Stop it!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
Who to?
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My President"...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
All right -
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Why wasn't I insulted?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Bah!! 
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
How lovely.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Well, these things take time.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Never mind that, I want my man!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I think I can.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
Yes.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Thank you very much.
Ohhh...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Not at all, John.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Yes, very soon.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
WELCOME?
What?
We never went to bed together.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
I... but I...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
That I cannot tell you.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
A lot of people like our singing.
You've got to let me go!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What about the raping?
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Why?
It saved my father!
I know!
That's my boy!
What "magic"?
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
No, don't say anything else!
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
What are you talking about?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
YOU do it!
She knows it was our fault!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Helpless...
Dad!
I hate you! I hate you!
You liar!
Yes, Mother.
I never do...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I told you that later.
You did? You liked me?
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Really? Because --
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Yeah, I got it.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
I like to read.
Sort of, um...
Very much.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I'm fine.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I think about that.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
No.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
It's freezing out here.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Long day thinking.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
It's not somebody else.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Very cool. Trippy.
We haven't checked.
What?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Hell no.
I swear.
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Thanks.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
I know who you are.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Like what?
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Why? Why do you have to go?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
What about the accumulator...?
No, thank you.
You weren't there. I saw it.
Can you shut it down?
Trauma.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
We'll make it.
No.
Oh God...
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What does?
From the Other Place...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
Start the countdown.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
What you got, Peters?
Crystallized.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Do it.
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
I don't know...
You can't, your orders are specific...
NOOO!
We don't have time to fart.
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Justin?
Keep your eyes open.
But you can breathe it.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
What's going on in there, Starck?
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
He served on the Goliath.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Can you shut it down?
1000 meters...
Explosive decompression.
I can't believe we built this.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It means nothing.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Victor must've taken him.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I can go hotter!
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Right, whatever, have fun.
I think that thing is Ben.
Blockhead started it!
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Sue... look at your hands.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
Are you kidding?
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Not at all.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Totally.
First door on your left!
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
They're not home yet.
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
What? Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Hello.
Did you get her name?
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
He is.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Well I never did it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Not coming? What happened?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Do you want to come inside?
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
Oh. I see.
Okay. Thanks.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Las Vegas.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
This is my granddaughter...
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Right.
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Hey!
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Oh, no.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Sure.
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
What do you mean what?
Nothing.
Seven.
Oh? And what's that?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
We all have to be strong, right?
Putting on my armor.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Thank you --
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Who?
GET OUT!
Sort of.
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
No. Never.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
Be careful, Francie.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I love you too, Francie.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Occupation?
Are you an actor?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
Forget it.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
The hell you will, Harry York.
What's left of my blood.
...Take advantage of me.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
No.
And no people.
What'd you do?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Mama, what's...
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Yes, Mama.
Mama...?
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I see.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Sedate her.
No!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Yeah?
You drove him to his torment.
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
It can't be as bad as that.
Why do you not go to them?
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
It's been months. It's not like him.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Father's so proud.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Why the change? What about your work?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
For what?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
The strain was evident.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
No, no, they're all dead...
Maybe I can help?
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I don't believe you...
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Don't call him.
You? The brick?
I call it my shower dream.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Girls can't be cowboys.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Yeah.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
My wife.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
You're a preacher?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Yes.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Knock yourself out.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
I'm gonna go get the money.
All I'm saying --
She's in the other room.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
This ain't the time.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Who's "we"?
But are there... I mean, how many...
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Motherachrist...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Fuck me.
Uh, ma'am.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
No, ma'am.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
So dump on me.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
That's a good story.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
You made a mistake.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Who is he?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
And how should we do that, Sir?
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
What are you suggesting?
Oh.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
How do I do that?
Well good, that's very... nice.
Where's my bed?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
"Just!?"
You go first! There's no time!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You have a better plan, Alex?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
How did you come to that conclusion?
That's It?
All systems are working, Commander.
Covalent... Right. So...
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
You smiled at me.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Tell them? About...
It helps.
Turn on the translation circuit.
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
You have ten seconds.
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
... Maintenance facility...
Former Commander?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
Well... Sort of...
You can oc that?
And determination.
Okay, let's go.
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Is that a fact.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
What?  What are you talking about?
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
Yes, my lord.
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
Who's in command out there?
Lafayette is a child!
Oh, come now...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Uh... none just now, but...
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
To win this war I need an army.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
It's stupid, of course.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Let's get you darker!
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
You're kidding me, right?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Farrah. Come here.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Harry, let me answer that.
You can talk to me.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I don't believe this.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
It's a different kind of deal.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Okay. So who are you?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
So what's the problem?
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
What Get Away jet?
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
How do I know that?
That's right. Three percent.
...That's what we finally decided.
"Cotton".
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Depends, who pays?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
You don't act like it?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
So we kill him?
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Smugglers maybe.
What is it?
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
Yeah, yeah.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
If money can buy what he wants.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
No.
Lights?
Who?
What guy?
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Greer?
Collision? With what?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Doesn't matter.
Showing you what?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
What?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
You got that right.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
We could call for help.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Fine with me.
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
I guess.
What?
JUST DO IT!
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I...
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Hey, look at this...
What a little hosebag.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
I'm going to tell him you said that.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Totally! Look!
Oh yeah...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Not really...
Somewhere downtown.
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Let's go hassle Josh.
"Hassle"?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That rules!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
No, really...
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
Nothing.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Maybe an orange juice.
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Hey, where are you going?
Five hundred.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Really? Can I see it?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Who knows?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Uh... sure... come in.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
But, I...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Yes?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
As are they all.
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Starling?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Then why do it?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
That is correct.  Nothing.
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
Good luck.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
This is more difficult-
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
We don't have a relationship.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Good luck.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not even good for me.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Now you're talking.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Then why have you come?
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
-- the sorrow --
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
You were the one who got me in.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And we're the ...
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
Who?
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
Well, thanks a lot.
Ummm -- figure eight?
No.  They're just coming to me.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
That's a violin concerto.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
You're the best one in your row.
He is the Destructor.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I think it's the food of the future.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
Why do you want to see it?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
See!  They are using drugs.
A square?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
What?  What popped in there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  We'll believe anything.
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
What is that... wailing?
Gladly Caesar.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Of course...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
No.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
With a family?
Oh my God --
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Oh.
What?
What did she say?
Oh.
I don't know.
When?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why do you have to see him?
What?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Yes, sir.
Ahhh.
What?
Right.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Where is it?
Is what a girl?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Pardon?
What?
Well I don't know.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Her portrait?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Do you understand what I said?
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
What?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
A hanger.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Is this -- what?
INADEQUATE!
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
I walk out.
We're talking.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Really. I want to know.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Don't start acting hurt.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Hey -- I don't get it.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
No.
Well --
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have we known each other now?
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
That's quite a statement.
They are?  Come on.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
Yes, sir.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
How?
Free --
Chasing what?
Will you do me a big favor?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
Yes -- tired...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Go away. Who are you --?
You are beautiful!
Oh -- 
And now?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
For Vienna?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
I can't.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
All right then.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Oh -- but -- I --
You are ill.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
I'm engaged for the evening.
You dance splendidly.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Money!
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Perhaps. 
I understand you perfectly.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Here, hold up!
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Then, it's all over?
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
We must call the police, your excellency.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I know -- I know.
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Pretty as a picture.
My son --
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
And if you do it wrong?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Well, uh... No.
Perk.
Fair enough.
Don't mention it.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
No. And you have to be.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I know you do, so that's why --
Not very good!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
You're too young. You should be in school.
I want to know everything about you.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
We'll rent a car.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
Upstate where?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Running your broker scam, you mean.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
That's what I say.
What?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Thank you.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Well, when you put it that way.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
No shit.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Will, sit down...
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Can I come in?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Okay... thank you.
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
What?
What are you looking at?
I can't believe this is happening.
Yeah.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Shit, Linda!
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
You've been watching too much TV.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Kara, no!
Retiring.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Um.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'm liable to find anything!
So long, Colonel.
Let's talk about it some other time.
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
First Nagasaki--now this.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Sorry.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
You did?
I wanted to apologize.
Blue soup.
What?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Is anybody besides you here now?
He worships Father.
They were in the same creative writing class.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
England?
Wow.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Go on.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Can't it keep till morning?
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Damn.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Who was it?
It's Mom.
Nothing.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
This is crazy.
Some kind of animal?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I have a brain.
Ram it up your ass!
You're a woman, aren't you?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
No.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
I don't think so.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You haven't heard me yet.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
I've struck my blow.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
My violin is avenged!
Was I ever of use?
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
It was a bitch.
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
No.
Father's friend.
Don't know.
What?
I don't get it.
He can hardly talk.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Good night.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Is he all right?
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
Take plenty of cigars.
She quit this afternoon.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
What kind of a life is that?
It's suicide!
I'm amazed.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Or get eaten alive.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Yes, we do.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
No, just not the type.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
No, I don't.
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I don't know no Tod.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I am.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
No.
I care about my daughter.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
On your own land?
What makes you so sure?
I can't tell you that.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
...What do you have to offer?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
You are.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Like what?
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Rucker.
Let's go.
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
But I...
I don't know nothing, man.
Sounds all right.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What do you think of that? Or this?
I don't know.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
You're taking a big chance.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Thanks.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Come again.
Lady, let me get this straight.
We planted it.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
No.  I thought not.
Yes.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
All right.
You don't look eighty.
Why not?
But this is public property.
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Where's that?
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
What is it, Harold?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
At a funeral.
Why?
I don't know.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
What would you say?
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
You think so, sir?
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She took my head.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
We have no more surprises.
Frank.
No. You look...
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
So you slept O.K.?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
Who?
You mean, outside... with her.
We don't take hints.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
See? I don't like that --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His what??!!
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
I'm in charge. We go back!
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Father's back?  Still angry?
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Not hungry.
Not from you.
Goodnight.
Uh-huh.
No. That wasn't the deal.
You can keep them.
It's important.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Kirsty?
No.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Tell me who you are.
Keep your voice down.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What's the problem?
We're going to freeze to death.
No argument.
Why not?
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about?
Please.
That's right.
Daddy?
You'd like the house.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Never better. You sleep well.
Gone?
What's the problem?
I AM house-trained.
Are you alright ?
It's a fetish of mine.
What happened to you?
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
But now I kind of like it.
We can take your car.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Laura.  Her dad died.
What?
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
NO--!
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Huh?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
Think about it, Rob.
Hi.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
Will you please just go?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Want to know what, exactly?
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
I know.  I don't get it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
You haven't even seen it!
Yes.  You?
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
We're not there yet, Justin.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Would you remember his name?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Anything in Maryland is close.
Very traditional.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Grave robbers?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Where?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Go home.
No.  I had to talk to you.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
A little dusty.
Yes.
I hope I never get that old.
Of bodies.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Is that a threat?
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
Yes.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Never take up poker, Detective.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Why?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
You're not from these parts.
Aye.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You're a long way from Inverness.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You know me home.  Me name.
You feel you know me.
We are immortal.
No!
How can I stop such a man?
Again.  Try again.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
It's all we have.
You're wrong.
So sure?
Equals?
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
Kahn?
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Do you?
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Hildy!
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Sort of a Jack London style?
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Fine.
Yes!
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
Do you want to get us scooped?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Please! Will you just --
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
You said it.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Was she? Did you notice?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
It'll be Heaven!
They can't do that to me!
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
That's all right.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
Cover up that transmitter!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
I won't.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What do you mean?
Forty dollars.
Yes, yes!
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
A very fine-looking women.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Apparently so.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
Ask her yourself.
He's the worst liar.
I'm starting my own collection.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
I will if you will!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Half the time he's bluffing.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
How long?
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Cool.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
You're welcome.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
That's not something to joke about.
What?
You know... a couple of queers.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
You shouldn't a done that.
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
How much further?
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Lock the fucking doors.
It's a girl.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
When?
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Recover any bodies?
Yes, sir.
What do they call you, sweety?
I don't doubt that.
Firefly.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Let's go see.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Gabrielle.
Oui. Perfect!
Not at all.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Gabby, what is it?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Okay. If you think it will help.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
As do I.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I'm not sure.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
I don't think so.  Why?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Such as what womanly things?
Should I come with?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Twelve thousand.
What did he say?
Thought you only drank milk.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Thanks for the drink.
For me.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
I don't know when it was.
Man named Turk Baker?
I been thinking.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
I don't know.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
All right. Five hundred.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
The expensive kind.
You well-heeled, partner?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Why?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Now and then. Why, do you?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
By all means.
Half and a dollar.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Yes.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Can I buy you another drink?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I used to be an actress.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
Don't you ever cook anything?
A loser?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
He's a gambler.
Well, what else does?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Shut up.
Hundred dollars?
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
We move.  Place to place.
You're not them.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Shhh... don't talk.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
You got that right.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
It was so real, Dad.
Good night.
Mr. Gardner, I --
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
Oh?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
That signal. It's a countdown.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
He wasn't the President then.
This I can see.
We'll meet you there.
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Then God help us.
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
Yes, I am.
You know me...
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
But, Mr. President...
Many worlds...
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
All my life!
Alexandretta. Now we know.
The Name of God...
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
I usually don't either.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
You do.
All I have to do is scream.
Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
Don't call me that, please.
I'll never forgive myself --
Through the library?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Look, can we discuss this later?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
My Diary's in Berlin.
What final challenge?
What about Marcus?
Very well. I'm here now.
I know, Dad!
You call this archaeology?
After you, Junior.
Yes, sir!  Haaa!
Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.
You think so?
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Why they glow like that?
Behind you!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
The old man saw it in a dream.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Don't let it curl around you!
It's starting to let go!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
What does the writing say?
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Dr. Jones?
Willie!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
There's got to be another way out.
Yes.
Your name is Al...
No.
Yeah...Who?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
You gotta help.
I'm not leaving until you do.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
I'll sue.
Door's locked.
Go out, take your first left.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
It's illegal.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Eat it?
It's sand.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What can I do? You're on your own.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
To the hotel. To register.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Is something glinting?
What am I supposed to do?
Run, stupid!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
I can't see a thing.
Come on.
I've got an idea.
Looks like you can have all you want.
I have been... I think you're right.
She works for them.
What part what?
I insist.
Let us get to the border!
ya hyutn slulptsa?
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
That name's familiar.
And how do you service foreigners.
Oh.
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Take the card.
Just give me the keys.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Oh...I can't. Business.
Let you leave without it.
What way?
As if your mind's not all there.
You talk to yourself.
You're doing...Okay.
Who else is interested in me?
You work for Ryuji?
You did.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Then why are you smiling like that?
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
Hong Kong.
You've  been there?
Can you?
What did you tell them?
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Now what?
It was you.
But you did it. It was you.
Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
It will be fine. You have another.
The other working.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Instant rice...?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
Where?
There's Dad, on TV.
Sure. Where?
I'll be there.
Push it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
No, I'm not...
What caliber is my gun?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Don't you have to be at the office?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
No, thank you.
That's for food.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Oh, baby...
Okay. Thank you.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
Hardly new news.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Alright. What did you think?
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
How have you liked your stay?
Black, black...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
No.
You believe that?
What?
Where you staying now?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
Object!
Seven...
He --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Howard!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
-- and we are sure...
What part?
Excuse me?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
No...
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
What the hell is Botox?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Yes.
You like kids.
It's about time.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Isn't everything?
He wants a reconciliation.
Gotcha.
But why him?
Have you tried the duck?
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
No. Don't stop.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hello Marylin.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Marylin?
That's true.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Sometimes I forget.
Please!
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Wow.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
I'm dying.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Right.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
That's delusional.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
She always looked out for me.
In anticipation of making you sick.
I am very sorry.
Is she going through with it?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
South America!
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Fine man to fall in love with.
No, I'll go through with it.
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Oh, please, Dad—
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
Huh?
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
My ticket?
What are you talking about?
That's none of your business.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um. You're doing all right.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
You always want to run everything.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Yes.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Thought you were hungry!
was so scared—that it scared—
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Nope.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
You're forgetting you're married.
Congratulations.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Who—me?  Want to see me?
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Whatever you say, darling.
Yeah? Where?
That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
What's on your mind?
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Yeah. Just babies.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Keep saying what?
You're not digging.
What's the other name?
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
Gee, thanks boss.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
You still questioning any Cubans?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
Why?  What's wrong?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
I want the truth.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
What?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Well... yeah.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
What are you driving at, boss?
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
They're gonna love you, chief.
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did. 
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Never touched me.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
And Oswald?
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I know. That's why I went.
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
I understand.
I'll call her.
You.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Uh-huh.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
Why does it need to be dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Ordell pick up his bond?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
How'd you feel about it?
Bigger?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
You think he's got a thing for you?
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Why?
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Where's the rest of it?
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
He's liable to shoot you.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
What's he doing?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
If I don't cooperate?
Not every day?
Yeah?
If I'm working, I can help you.
He sells guns.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
How can you help us?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Not yet.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
But you didn't do that.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I thought you were watching him.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Do you got something for me?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Yeah.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
All your money's in Mexico.
It's a cockatoo.
I do okay.
It's true, isn't it?
What did they say?
A woman.
Managers get ten percent.
Who?
I need to talk to you alone.
Designer clothes.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Bank robbery.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
I thought you were sixteen.
Were you a disco girl?
I don't like dancing.
Uh-huh?
What's your cost?
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Where did you shoot her?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Have fun.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Livingston, huh?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
House.
I can see that. Why?
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
And you did that to protect my interest?
My office.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
I know where to turn.
No.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
What are you then?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
No, don't. But thanks.
I could have told you that.
Oh, terrific.
Just my luck.
What else did he say, Jake?
How long had that been going on?
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
How do you know?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Who?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
She hates me, Louis.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Thanks.
Did you look around the headboard?
I must have been out of my head.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
How's it going?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Where?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Coming here?
That's your decision.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
I love you, Jez.
How come? The army?
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
You've lived with me for two years.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
Jake, what is it?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Sit down!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Like it was yesterday.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
Never?
I don't know.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
No. I couldn't.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
I no from around here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Total delirium.
Call my chiropractor.
I'm awake?
Nothin' much.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
That black car?
What's goin' on Paul?
You've seen them?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
We don't have time to argue!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Thorgan, pull us in.
And you said high school was boring.
What are you doing back?!!
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
And now we're all out of it.
I am an expert!
Not a chance.
You just keep an eye out.
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
I thought you meant...
And what happend to ...?
I think I had some when I was eight.
I know you.
I'm stuck!
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Again?! Jesus!
He was chasing me!
GO, GO, GO!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Just get us to the ship!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Small brains make your balls itch?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Ssh.
Then open the doors!
What?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
4You're not going anywhere.
Sure, Dad.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Older, sillier.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
What d'ya mean?
Swell.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
You could say that.
How can you tell?
I wish it would rain...
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
You picked her up on the ferry.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
No way! He can't!
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Or something.
I miss it too.
We could get back together too.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
I try really hard, actually...
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
Shut up.
I rock a Harmony.
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, more commercial stuff.
Oh.
No, he's the dad.
I know what junk is.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Hey, I like this.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Cute?
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Come on, I have something for you.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
You're gonna like this, I promise.
God, you're so young.
I heard that was you.
Well, it was nice seeing you.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Nothing.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
What?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Keith's hot.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
A Pilates machine?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What are you referring to?
Looks like it, yeah.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
...Thank you.
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Not so good. You sure you have to?
...Too bad.
How much do I owe you?
Forget it.
...Then some.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Yeah?
A... I gotta go.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Funny, very funny.
Take your time.
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
No.
Siesta.
...You're hurting me...
What is it?
Without his car?
She can fuck?
What do you want?
He lives on 76th?
78th.
Did she suck your dick?
Yep.
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
Unzip my pack, yo.
Yeah me too nigga.
Who?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Shut the fuck up.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Yeah. Come on.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Here. Swallow.
Because your a virgin?
Of course I do.
What?
I guess so.
Yeah.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Are you in trouble with the law?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You are being ripped open.
Did you bleed?
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
I only did it once and...
No. I just gotta go find him.
What happened?
Sweet.
Yeah.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Shh.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
Anything?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
It's a voice modulator.
Just a second.  Hello?
Did you know her?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
By that time the game will be over.
Let me speak to my daughter.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
Very good.  How did you know?
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Thanks.
Of course not.
What scars?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Boys.
That has nothing to do with it.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
What about prints?
That's great.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
That's got to be it.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Is it serious?
About what?
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
What are they, please?
It's alright.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
No.  I don't.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
It is.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
I don't think I could.
Let's change the subject.
Of course.
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
Why?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
She died in a car accident.
And you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
You.
Nothing.
He didn't tell you either.
I'm not nervous.
Me too.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
All directions are the same here.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
What do you see?
But you suspect.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
I don't think that.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Naturally.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
He will not!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
I knew.
A match for your son, I think.
How many did you lose?
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is too late. He has drunk.
She was not as beautiful.
I killed him when he was born.  This place is my punishment.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
Why do you want to know?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
No.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
130... 140...
Perfect.
What?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
...Later.
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
I love you so much, Leon.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...I don't know.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Huh, that's good!
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
Why am I such an authority?
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
It's impossible.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
Maybe later.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
Yes -- you are.
You do?
Okay.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Twenty miles?  I see.
There was no card.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
I've changed my mind.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
You know what... I remembered you were here and I woke up.
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
That's me.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Maybe.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
So I've been informed.
What, come on?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you think I should get?
Hello.
Are you working?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
OK... whatever.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Yes.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
With an old friend.
It's me, Yuri.
No.
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Go to hell.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Sort of.
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
No. I was in the shower.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
I think so...
What'd you do?
That's terrible!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
How'd it go at the trial?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Really?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Not yet.
Why?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
But maybe it is --
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
Projecting joy is not my job.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Maybe she found him like that.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
What, like it's that hard?
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
Really?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
Oh, yes...
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
I fear she's lost.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Stealing his arms?
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
The chill is worse this night.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
There must be some way to get it up there.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Easier than that, Jack.  Screwball!  Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I'll try.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Sport, indeed.
What shall we do?
Shhh!
Jack!
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Only what's right...
What?
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
I can't see a thing.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
She's dead!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Sorry.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
And am I not fair?
That was in jest.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Please...
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
You do know where it is?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
What color?
You'd better call and cancel.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
He seems lonely.
You're a good girl.
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
What are you talking about?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
We're getting out of the ground today.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I'll ask.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
Because I live there.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'll hate you forever.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I know.  Why?
Nothing.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
I would have killed him.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Here.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I know there's an explanation.
I want you to find someone for me.
Because Dad left?
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
When's school over?
What?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You're not well.
My stupid back.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I think so.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
I'd rather you not be here.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
You've never said that before.
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I wasn't sure.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
What are you doing home?
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
No.
I didn't go in your room.
Yeah.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Someone stop her!
No, nigger.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Goodnight, Claude.
I don't think so.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
That's some long green.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
You need collateral.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
It ain't here.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
What does that mean?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Crawfords.
Make 'em throw strikes.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
That's the way it is.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Goodnight, Ray.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Made just for you, Cookie.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Move it out.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Me? Willie Long.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
You shouldn't have come here.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Absolutely not.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
What do you think about... Earth?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You mother...
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Don't do it!
Sure, why not?
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Yeah, you do...
It's not me, moron.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Son, just do your best.
Beast.
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
No.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You followed him?
All right...
Dude. Seriously?
Really?
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
I love you.
A black guy?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
What other food?
Just the face.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
At Carousel tonight?
Where do you live, Mary?
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
All right.
A Runner gave it to me.
You're not going, are you?
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Some people say children need human mothering.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Beloved wife...
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Alive?
Will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Yeah.
What is?
Okay...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Alice?
What's up?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
No... Here he comes.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
When he went to work, right.
A headache?
My... My head.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Wake me up when you get home.
All right.
No... of course not.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
All right!
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
What'd I tell ya.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
At your house. Don't you remember?
You were acting like a different person.
It was weird...
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Uh-huh.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Don't call me brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
Why, of course. Yes.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
You mean you don't want to go?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Goodness, no!
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
He amputated his own leg?
Very often.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
Suppose she should leave it?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
No.
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Now, what would you like to do?
As far away as I ever want to be.
Yes.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Hello? Colonel?
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
Yes, Bob.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Well - I mean—
Nothing about the porters yet?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
You can't leave, George.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Yes.
What do you suggest?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Why?
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
It's Fenner.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
It'll make sense later?
Kay...
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
You heard me.  You two, especially.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Gee.  You really think?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What?
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
What if I don't?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Anderton --
The other two will die without me.
Found?  Where?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
Yes, you did.
Kill type?
For that, we have to go for a ride.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Lara --
Don't apologize, John.
Yes, sir.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Take your time.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
So now I need you to hack into her.
It's a little late for that.
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
No.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Why should I trust you?
Sean --
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
I'll be right there.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
He's my subordinate!
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
Two?
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
Yes.
Cream and sugar.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You mean after he lost your son.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Yes, sir.
Yeah. Take it.
Holy shit.
Should I fuck him?
I want spaghettis.
I don't know.
I love you. Come home.
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I feel weird asking him.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Yeah.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Good morning.
Depends what night.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I thought you hate that club.
We don't need guns.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
I like it.
I like it.
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She really liked the kitchen.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't know.
About what?
Back in.
She was jonesing for me.
We're getting whacked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Eighty five.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
I'll be a minute.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
You strapped?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
You really in trouble?
Watch it...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes.
She poured it for --
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
I am.
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
How 'bout that?
I like you, country.
Bet you are.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
What you talking?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
There's two guns on you.
Now.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
Who are you?
I sure met some.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
I'll be away a lot.
You're with me even when you're away.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let some of us come down there.
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
"His greatest greatness."
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
If she got eyes, she do.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
I ain't stupid.
I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
What mission?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
The hell you are.
That's right.
Head nigger in charge?
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
He told you that?
Am I a suspect?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
So you are going to talk me to death.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[I have a friend there.]
I guess that makes you the smart one.
So what do I get in return?
I'll call you tomorrow.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[No!]
[Who are you?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Show me, please.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
It's better to be free, right?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
It's Creasy.
[No. Why?]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Our daughter.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
I already ate.
You helped him get this job.
And they took that away.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I don't think I remember him.
You told me.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
I know it pains.
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
I'd like that very much.
Okay.
Goodnight.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Sure.
Hello, Thomas.
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Waddaya talking about?!!
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Home.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I got some.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
But what about Major Houlihan?
You betcher ass, Dad.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
No, no, that one.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
I don't get it.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
I didn't have much choice.
Yes, Reverend?
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
Glad to help.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
Nope, we're assigned heah.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Yes, Colonel.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
Arterial silk.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
No, thank you.
No.
About me?
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
A deal?
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
I wish he had a family, though.
Oh.
Well, maybe you're right.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes.  What's he doing here?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
What do you do when you work?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I'm stuck with two and two—but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
What do you mean, too bad?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
SWAT wants to go in.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
You want me to go up with you?
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Is that all?
I'll give you something.
How do you feel after a shooting.
I know.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
It was okay.
Where did you hear that?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
I'm not good at lying.
What's the first commandment?
To run last?
The jockey!
He's cutting down the visibility.
You're crazy.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Which apartment?
And it's hard to get.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
When?
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Scottie...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
You let us worry about that.
I need to take back what's mine.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
To live forever.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
It's not real.
Yes...
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
And what about the reconfiguration?
What about the customers with reservations?
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
-- He won't.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Christoph changed the maze.
Why would I do that?
Night City.
You weren't real.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Just like that?
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
... I just pray we're not too late.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
TRICERATOPS!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
Ryan's Comet!!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
LET'S DO IT!?
You've got the public upset, Al.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Tell me about it.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Could we step outside?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
I can just imagine.
For being a man.
Same here.
It's a mask.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
The name's Charlie.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
The Big Picture.
Shuddup.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Anything!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
Yeah...before your time.
Sad commentary, huh?
I didn't say anything.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Are you okay??
The ring...
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
You want to come inside?
Uh-huh?
... What are they all doing there?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Aaron?
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Really?
What happened?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I did not--
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Blow a bugle!
No!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
What is it?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
All right, why?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Yes, Jim.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
*But you never asked me*!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Than what?
Emma!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Look! There it is!
I yield.
In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Will he *yield*?
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Yes, Ma?
Sorry about this, Governor. But it won't take a minute. You were saying something in the other room, sir--
What?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Convene?
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Punch?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
Have you always had to--work?
Go right ahead.
I also answer to whistles.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No! Stop it!
I've got more. You better tell me.
You--don't know it, do you?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Not another bill?
Do you want to dictate them?
Saunders--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
What! Who?
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Sometimes he whistles.
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Tell me more about yourself.
No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Now, what do you see?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Thank you.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Have lunch.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Is he really that big a sap?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Right.
John—
Gold, eh?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Perfect! Perfect!
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
What was that you said he was?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
All set.
When?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Nah.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
Naturally.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Now wait a minute, buddy—
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
I write poetry.
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota - north?
Yes, sir.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Prairie? Oysters?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Yeah.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
I'm fine.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Right now?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Why not?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Henry!
Go to hell.
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Mr. Gilroy --
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
What?
Yeah.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Sure.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
Is she against you getting help?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Disgusting.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
You're upset.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
What was that?
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Good-looking woman.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
You don't think I'm insane?
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Definitely.
You were messed up, man.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
You're not going to kill us?
Oh yes, of course.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
To be hanged.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
You swear?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Who was talking about what?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No, we are not.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
FINE.
I think you were jealous
Yes?
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
So who killed him?
The Disco Boys.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
What did he mean?
Hello?
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Get on to yourself!
Why bother?
Really?
Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Not tonight. 
I just want to be a superhero.
I'm going inside.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Because that's what it is.
I'll drive.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Wait!... Look!
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
No.
The Eradicators!
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Definitely.
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Great timing!
Through there!
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
No, thank you.
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I don't know, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Come in.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
Oh?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
Yes, it must be.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Oh, yes... of course.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Ah, that is good.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
I will never forgive you.
I don't understand you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Open the door.  It's me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Will you be joining us, soon?
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
We have a treaty with Austria.
That is a matter of opinion.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
Show him in.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
You know what he mean, dude.
I'm gone.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
My brothers won't give me a ride.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Have you seen Day-Day?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
I know.
Why did he go in the house?
And some rolling papers.
Call me.
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
What urgent message?
I can't feel my legs no more.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Nothing.  What you want?
'Take your car?'
What's the matter?
What's he doing here?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
My security people are right next door.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
What?
The gun...
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You fucked up.
Don't you threaten me.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I think you're right.
I remember. The big tipper.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Oh, Jesus ...
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
Thanks for the tip.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
What gives?
No.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Hm!
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
No.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
Twenty-five wives!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Ah.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
How?
What!
'Cause you're too little.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Dead.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
No. No one never did.
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
I -- no, I --
Them kids is yours?
She took them kids with her?
No, nothing.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Who was scary?
Slept like a rock.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
How you plan to do that?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
Krueger.
School.
I will.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Nobody's gonna kill you.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
Yeah, nuts.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
And you too, Ninotchka.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Yes, General Savitzky?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
That's perfect!
Thank you, Louis.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Comrade.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Just looking around.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
We did our best, Comrade.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
What can I do about it?
I think so too.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Suppress it.
I will do my best.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I don't like your following me.
Why?
On which boat?
I have never heard one.
I don't think so.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
A funny story?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Comrades! Good people of France!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Much happier.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
Good morning, Swana.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana, you did.
No... please...
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Has done what?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
I must ask you to leave.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
No, we have nothing to hide.
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
To protect his people.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
You do it.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
That's right ...
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
I know it well, sir.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
All right.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Sir ... six bodies.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Mother, think of me always as your faithful dog ...
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
I don't think we can treat this as a formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal promise to the Russians not to invade Cuba.  But you authorized Dr. Kissinger to put this in writing.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
The old queen did it on purpose.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
I always get my man.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
Who we working for?
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
The American people put me where I am.
No, Henry.  I don't.
There's no other choice.
We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
I was the lesser of two evils.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
Jesus Christ!
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
That was a long time ago.
... Use his women.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Compassionate.  Grateful.
I know ...
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
You personally?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Thank you.
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
To what?
What?
You heard it?
How fresh is this coffee?
No ID in her room?
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Who's he in trouble with then?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
He can take all comers.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I'm hidin' behind you.
I don't know. He ought to...
You gonna drive out there?
Yes I do. You don't want to lie without what it's absolutely necessary.
Hyah!
No.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Yeah.
Goin' where?
Well -- how come?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Why would I let you do that?
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
All right.
You know she won't be there.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With what?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
How's that?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Okay.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
I want you to take me to another motel.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Took me about three hours.
I'm a welder.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Don't jack with me.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
A woman can write a check.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I don't think I am.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Yeah, me too.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You never gave us a chance...
You're late, Eric.
What happened when you were twelve?
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Yes... maybe it was.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
What?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Did you love it?
Really?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
He has no heartbeat!
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
You still in love?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
IT SURE IS!!
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
I'm not telling.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
I'll think about it.
I said I'll think about it.
...yeah.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Better.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
- but now it deposits you here.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Four hundred, Delmar.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Well sure, honey, but...
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Aw, that's all right.
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Great.
Thank you, sir!
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
I know.
How're you doing, Sarge?
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I said, come here!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Then, I'll see you around.
I'm a little late, that's all.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
What's stopping you?
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
When I'm good and ready.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Because he's my friend, too.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
I've seen better.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
But she expects you to marry her?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Are you gonna open the safe?
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She better.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
This was your department, Junior.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Different tables.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
What do you want?
You don't look so good.
Don't!
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
No, Edgar Allen.
Shoulda got an apartment.
478...
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Shaky?
No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Give me a break.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
He WILL.
I'm sorry.
Why?
What?
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Yeah you do. It's up to you either here or downtown.
What's with you?
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
Look this is bull...
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Can you make a deal with them?
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
Wait a second there brother...
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
Yeah.
I don't know.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What, I don't know how you mean?
Brimmer.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Maybe...
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Where is he?.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
You believe that?
No.
His journals, letters, maps, books...
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
You couldn't have known.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Goodbye.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
My pleasure, sir.
Apology accepted.
Oh?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
You're in no condition to ride.
Oh?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Flanking riders?
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
What?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
You know what happened.
Go on.
Yes.
You don't hate him.
I stand corrected.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
That's a damn long time...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Where is he now?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
Is that right, dad?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I know.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
What were you listening to?
Allman Brothers.
Sure.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Yes, but--
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
You keep saying that.
Don't worry about that.
Because it's right.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Yes.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
No you won't.
Track you down and --
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Can I trust you?
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
I can't breathe.
You're speaking up for him again?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Commodore, please!
That would hardly be proper.
Ceremony?
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Nor did you, I noticed.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
That he is.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Indeed.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
Aye!  Avast!
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
On what?
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
What I asked you earlier?
The nanobot is gone.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
It already is.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Yes.
Daniel!
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
What about it!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Probably the caffeine.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
We've got to get the nanobot.
I remember I was trying to help...
Oh yes you are!
That's right.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Don't worry, four eyes.
Yes - isn't it.
You're all right.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
I know that.
I poisoned him.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Look! Look! The front page!
Is that so?
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Oh yeah?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
I'm afraid.
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Yeah?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Araby?
No!
Oh no, sir!
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
—and that—
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
It's the smoke.
Not since you broke into society.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Staring at us?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Conrad.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
You don't.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Sure.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Hello, Joe.
Are the cars ready?
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I won't.
I don't know.
All night?
I was in a bowling-alley.
I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You want to get out of here?
Lover's Lane!
"Changes."
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
No. What?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Yes I did.
We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
Green.
What are you doing?
We're supposed to be in school.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
Owns the hardware store.
I don't think so.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
What?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
No. I baked them for you.
Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
... Lover's Lane?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
What's that like?
Rain.
It was a prop for the school play ...
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
What department store did they go to?
That's right.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Excuse me?
Why?
EXCUSE ME?
Why?
Listen to me!
Just listen to me ...
Yeah.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
And what was this?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Yeah I can't.
I'm sorry.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
No.
I'm in my bedroom.
Really?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
...yes...
You sound very cute, very nice.
Not very late.
Yes.
Me?
No. I'm sorry.
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
This makes me very uncomfortable.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No you won't.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
I'll see you later.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Thank you.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
...what...?
Yes I'm sorry.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Did you do it?
Your hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
I think you have a call?
.....Well yes I do....  But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Hi, Lance.
You're goin' on a trip?
Let's just leave it there for now.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
You gotta give me some money.
Wait a minute --
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
You can't be late.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
When can you leave?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Nothing.
Put him through.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Yeah.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Mother's not half so blind as you.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
What on earth would that require?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
His wife's influence.
And --?
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher mission.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
-- words alone are insufficient.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
He needs me here.
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Uh-hub.
Why is that, Louis?
This picture--
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
There is nothing to discuss-
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
Not for me.
You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't  t-t-t-tolerate it.
I can't remember the lines!
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Huh?
What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity.
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Can I talk to Hearst?
Forget it-
But with compassion and insight--
Oh Christ
Mank-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
How?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Very generous
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Get out.
CITIZEN KANE
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
I really think you're
It was fun, wasn't it?
It was the best, kid
Yes!
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
What?
And where you goin'?
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Hit me in the face.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
You wasn't with her, were you?
Huh?
You wasn't with her?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Yeah, I know.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What do you mean, "you"?
You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
It feels real good.
Just give it a nice little tap.
No.
What does that mean?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
I was just...
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
You asleep?
Huh?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Yeah --
OK. Talk.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Then what?
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
C'mon, Tommy --
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
Jefferies?
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
What time?
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
You did.
Jeff --
Why should I?
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
That's normal.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
That's the hard part.
How did you know!
I was.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
And you love life?
Uh-huh.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
There's nothing to see.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
I don't know.
What doesn't?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Is he cleaning house?
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Nobody chickened.
Buzz Gundersen.
Okay.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
You make any sandwiches?
And you dropped it?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Well, now--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I still think you should go down.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
No.  It's okay.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Do I have to spell it out?
No.
Try the desk.
Chicken?
Bully for you.
See?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
No.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
We have to go back!
What's he like?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Do you think your father means that?
That one?
No.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Gabriel!
We're talking, aren't we?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
What the fuck is going on.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
We? What "we"...
Nick...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Well. I'm going home.
Who wouldn't.
I never told you my name.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
But you were saying you were...
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
A station wagon in Canada.
Her brother.
No. It's her brother.
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
And I worked there. For a year.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Don't tip.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
No, Gabriel... no...
I'm no threat without a gun.
And where they hide the real money.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Three days, man.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Yeah.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
What, working security?
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
...be with her...
NICK!!!
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
You're hitting for MY cards!
Who the hell made this map.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
How do you know all this?
Bullshit.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
Pam Grier.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Yeah.
A little.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Sorry, it's my book now.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip.
Nope.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
We think we got a rat in the house.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
You really think we were set up?
That's not correct.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
A few cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Of course.
This is what he was doin'.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Hold on.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Hurry up.
A man I used to know.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Yes.
That's right, Steve.
You'll live.
Don't act so -- crazy.
It isn't that --
Just a thing I was workin' on.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Well, say it.
They shouldn't have done that.
That's it then.
Good night, Steve.
Then I know my alphabet.
And you've got me all figured out?
Thanks, Steve.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Ha! Right bitch!
Alex, what are you doing?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Would you die already?!
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
You sure?
Open chest!!!
Shhh!
Hugh Kane.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
She killed herself a week before he died.
Oh, right.
I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.
This can't be happening?
I'll go.
My child, you're alive!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Huh?
Hey, I got an idea.
I wouldn't go that far.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it, Dwight?
Father, come in, please.
Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
What?
Get out?! What does it say?
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
0h, shit!
You said you hated him.
I certainly did not.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
But, Chip...
You mean for TV or print?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
I beg your pardon?
I certainly was not!
So you admit you just lied?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Are we leaving?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Where?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
No.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
What is it?
Why?
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Good.
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
The people at the restaurant?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
What things? Why?
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
But I'm not joking.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
And then?
Yes.
But you're always at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I keep telling myself that.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'd forgotten.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
Perhaps
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
She's not been here for a long time.
But she was here?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell —-
No, not really.
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Basically, yes.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
I can see that. What are they?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
What do you have to do to get ready?
It won't. Are you ready?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
You said you weren't always impotent.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Why not?
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Why not?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
You're not answering me.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Well, are you?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
Loud.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
No, I haven't.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
That you are under no obligation to me?
Why, so you can go after him?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
He wouldn't do that.
It was busy.
So will you, someday.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
I just want to know why you're here.
She still is.
She didn't give you my address?
Nope.
Spooked.
Would anybody else see the tape?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Cynthia. John.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Nothing wrong with trying.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Hung up.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I like having the car, the car is important.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
Was he nice to you?
Sure.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
We live in 703.
Didn't seem worried about them.
I don't get it.
Yes?
No? How come?
Listen, Rog. I knew Hobbes was funny, you know? I told you that. But I didn't really know just how funny he was. See... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. I'm Hobbes's partner, right?  Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
Yeah? What do I do then?
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
He was adopted you know.
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Of course.
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Why?
I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
Me?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Flavors!
CRIMINAL
We're not confused.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Good. That's good.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Huh.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
Me too.
That's on us.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Just tell me.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Want some?
Just a minute!
Whoa.
Pour us a couple.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Perfect.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Thanks, Jack.
What do you think's going on?
Slaughterhouse.
No.
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
I know what you need.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Keep it elevated.
Yeah.
Me?
Quite a week.
No, I'm okay.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Whatever. Sorry.
You were wearing your belt.
The Windmill.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah. Definitely.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Sure.
Like what a fraud he was.
What rehearsal dinner?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
Right.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
I heard them Morgan.
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
I heard.
Yes it was.
What time is it?
Ray Reddy's house.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
We have to go in the basement.
I'm looking!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Yes.
I just asked his name.
They win.
They think it might happen all at once.
I'm sorry.
Have to.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Yeah... that must have been it.
It's one thing to know it...
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
It's not going to be easy.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Believe it.
What's that?
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Howdy.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
I am telling the truth.
-- It's called a projector.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I'll send you her resume.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Soon.  Soon.
Everyone you know is lying.
She doesn't want pity.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
No.
Not quite.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Just a minute.
Why?
Yes, call me Simone.
Please put your clothes on
Who are you really?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Absolutely not!
You can't.
I was misquoted.
I'm sorry.
"Straw God" changed my life.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Night, Lainey.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Er,... good.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Long live the First Amendment.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Thank you.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
I didn't leave you.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
He your best buddy?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Yes.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Tell you my secrets.
Dead people?
Ghosts.
...I don't know.
How'd he know I'd come?
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
I happen to be a professional.
Bus broke down.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Manure... is life.
"And a slash-slash there --"
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I don't think so.
I --
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Why bother?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Sorry.
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Oh, yeah?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
It's my nature.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Shelby --
Sorry.
Do it.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Through a wound on his stomach?
When one sees you they all see you.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Is this fun?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Eleven.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Uh-oh.
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Bandit II?
That man is your father?!?
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Or in the slammer.
No.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Because they said it couldn't be done.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
What does the old Timex say?
Do I have a choice?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Now what?
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
That's correct.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
I said I got his machine.
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
What are you doing here?
-- will be handled back in --
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...So you made another deal?
But you did, and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
You got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Wow.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
No shit.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
That takes some of the sting out.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
I can trust Rheya.
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
That's fantastic.
Why would you let her to do that?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Why, who did you see?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Just get him to stop.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Jesus...
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
What kind of look?
I did too.
You don't know?
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
You don't love me.
But that's what happened before.
I love you.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
I can't stay here.
Then you won't make it.
Am I really her?
He won't.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
You didn't like him?
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
Yeah, what a woman.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
No dog.
What do you want?
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Long enough.
Yeah...
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
What shit, honey?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
What's the difference?
No.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
Call a cruiser!
You in this with me?
Is she injured?
She's taking singing lessons.
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
Take care, pal.
Oh, sure.
No, no.
I'm parked illegally!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Harry!
That's not even close.
What's this? A cockaroach?
A spider.  Eight legs.
What if you get hurt?
I hate--
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
What?
Hurry up, Flash!
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
It'll shut itself off.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Really, Professor, I--
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Plenty.
Is you all good Nazis?
Coming up.
We'll get some more.
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
I'll call the whole pot.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
Isn't it?
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Say, Schulz --
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Some are not bad at all.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Good.
Any objections, men?
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
We did it.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Check.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
Yes, you do!
The Kommandant also sends you clean blankets. He wants every man to have a new, clean blanket.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
The station complement was nineteen.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You could say that.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
A photon torpedo?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Is there a problem?
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Lock phasers and return fire!
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Aye, sir.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Short range scan.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
... Or <u>who</u>.
Logic indicates that is the case.
That may be difficult...
Why?
... How long?
I don't understand.
You said there wouldn't be any.
None that I can detect, sir.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Sir...?
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
You would have done the same for me.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Fire, Mr. Scott!
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Indisposed, sir.
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Any time.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Success, my lord.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Exactly. Happy birthday.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Carol!
I know, I know...
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
Who --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
I can hardly see --
I saw it -- !
Never mind! Hurry!
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Are you running away from me?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
No!
Raise the shields...
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Aye, sir.
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Steady as you go...
Yes --
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Scotty!
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
I do this because I was there,
... They do, indeed.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Cramps.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
... My God...
That is what I said, Doctor.
Then how.?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
I am? May I go now?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
I suppose they told you that...?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
I buy that. What about him?
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
What's what?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
All right. The truth?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Explain.
... Simple logic.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
... I see.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Yes, sir.
On screen.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
... Are you joking?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Why?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
What's the rush?
I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women...
I don't.
Perhaps, that is true.
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
Data doesn't breathe.
Are they in any danger?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Safer than leaving her here.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Another time.
It is not over.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
The purpose being...?
Why not?
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
I'm not letting go of him.
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
We have to find shelter...
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
But it's comfortable.
I never kissed you with a beard before.
All ship functions are off-line.
I look forward to reading your report.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Bag him.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I'm your creator now.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Do it.
Where's the Sphere?
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
How serious is the damage?
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
<U>Engage.</U>
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Main bus...
The invasion plans.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Normally, I would agree. But in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. You're many things, Number One, but you're not much of an historian.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
No way.  You see this?
To be -
Retire.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
They'll make it look like an accident...
That's a comfort...
How can I trust --
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Captain.
You hear that?
I was asked by my father to open neg-
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Where?
From Enterprise?
I SHOULD have been -
Not yet... Section 4236...
Who else?
Faith...?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
I believe you. Please...
You having hearing problems, mister?
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
No.
Why?
Why?
No. I must deactivate you.
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There’s no crying in Starfleet.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Is he very much like you were?
Dying?
Not tonight, I have work here.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you "sad"?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Good work. The download?
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
I don't believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
How could I not?
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Counselor?
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
You sick bastard!
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
If you don't mind.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Aye, sir
Your new chair, sir.
Still well on our side...
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
And the Senate supports you?
Yes.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I don't know.
It’s too late.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Do as I tell you!
What?!
I came this far alone ...
Praetor.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know.  Take care of yourself.
Where's that?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
Which way do you want to go?
What.
Gear shift.
Pancakes.
I am husband?
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
You. Mouth closed.
Candy.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Three nights... two days.
No.
Yes.
Goodbye.
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
He will.
Are you my friend?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You don't forget anything, do you?
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
I want to gamble.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Yes.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
No.
Fly.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Very beautiful country up here...
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Wait'll you see it.
Yes.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Just not the eyes.
I live for the moment.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
Talk to me about costs, here.
What?  Right Here?
Thanks, Max.
That's not sayin' much.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
What else you got?
What?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Define illegal.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You'll see.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Black.  Jack.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Fire's out, isn't it?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
No.  It didn't.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Are you going to make me beg?
Aw, Mom!
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Um... he was older.
Anybody talk to the press?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
You tell me.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Let's take a look.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
What?
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Yeah.
What?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Not bad, huh?
What about his killer?
What?
What are you doing?
You refused to comply with a direct order.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
I don't believe this.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I understand.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
This is some serious shit.
What's that?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Don't be too harsh.
Sue Ann Hanson.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Then there's the other issue.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I just need to go a little slow.
What's up?
Suspect Zero.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
What's going on?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
Kulok.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Speck is dead.
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Take your shirt off.
It didn't feel that way.
Shut up.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Just like that?
Anything?
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
What an asshole.
You want this in black chips.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Yeah, hold on.
Really?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
No problem.
What do you want? You're tall.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
They turned you down?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You asshole.
...People get carjacked...
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
She's really special, guys.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
S'up Trent?
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Vegas!
Vegas!
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
You think they're watching?
I know, but...
Let's just leave.
I don't think so.
You think so?
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
What?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
Yeah, a good friend.
That was different.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
I just need some time...
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
Selling scrap metal.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
That doesn't matter.
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
...How novel.
No.
...you're money...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...Yeah.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Good.  He never doubted you.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
And what is that Bonasera?
But your daughter is still alive.
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Barzini.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
How bad will it be?
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
What percentages for my family?
Sure.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I'm going to finish school.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
What else do you believe in?
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Beautiful all over, eh?
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Okay.  One minute.
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
They're waiting to see my father.
They're talking to themselves.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
He's coming over here!
My brother, Tom Hagen.
And what do you want for Christmas?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
One of them fingered the old man.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Just be patient.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
It's vile.
Marge, you like everybody.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
And Rome.
Do you ski?  Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent.  Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
He's downstairs.
What are you talking about?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why?
What?
So cool.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Hardly.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
What about Cortina?
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Where's Dickie?
What does that mean?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
And you, sir? Any better?
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Oh Marge.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Is Freddie in Rome?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
You know what -- I am.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Thanks.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
No key, huh?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Why lie?
You're such a liar...
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Yes, mam.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Yes?
I can believe that.
I know. I could have picked you up.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
It keeps ya busy.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Well, I hope he wins.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Oh, Tom, please.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
For a fee.
One-Ball McCall?
I don't like my real name.
I musta been stoned.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Yeah.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Some. Here and there.
You moonlightin?
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
You would, huh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
What's going on?
Slow.
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Thanks.
You want to talk about it?
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Wrong.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Whatever happens.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Okay.  What's the second thing?
And  I love you, Pete!
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Dad... 
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Me too.
How'd they get it inside?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes it does.
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Harry, son.  Harry.
And... what's my name again?
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
They're...
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
Zackly.
Pete...
I... no, I... I just can't...
Call me... Ishmael?
She's very pretty.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
I was decorated.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
You can't testify.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
No thanks.
Not at all.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Some of it might come back to you.
What?
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
What exactly did you hear?
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
No, not really.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I despise it.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
I don't understand.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then go.
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
If your father were here...
Shhh. Shhhhh.
The little Brenner girl.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Of course.
Thank you.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
And certainly pretty.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Maybe we ought to leave.
Get a rope!
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
I'm awfully sorry.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
How can you tell?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Oh, no you don't!
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Certainly, but...
Famished.
Yes.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
No.
Why?
I told you what happened in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
What do you do?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Hear!
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
You said three o'clock.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, all right, but...
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Did he tell you about Georgina?
It is a pity.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
MacFarlane
I've heard of it.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Pulse?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I wanted to see the white horse --
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
I have other means of sustenance.
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
A pleasure to torment me?
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Only Brother.
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
You sent them. I had no choice.
Tell her... we'll get him.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
I think we should get some support?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Yeah, I know.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
I don't know. I found him lying there.
You mean Alex.
You killed my daughter.
I do. Every day.
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
Yes -- that is true.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Okay.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
All right.
Why not, Bobby?
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
I'll say goodnight again.
About five months -- your months.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Come on in.
What about him?
Is that what you're thinking about?
Goodnight, my dear.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
What time is it?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Yes -- Just exactly.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
What's Plan B?
El Vampiro.
<u>Four</u> to go.
That's right.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Sam, don't --
Lots more where he came from.
Good!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
What happened?  Is everybody all right?!
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
No... no, everything's different now...
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Huh?
Save Laddie first.
Will you give Mom a break?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Piss off.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You promise?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Now who'd go and do...
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
The dogs?
Garry's missing!
What for?
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
I think so.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
No.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
The generator!
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
Bet the last place you ever go.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Do you know where they live?
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
What?
What do you mean?
End...?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
So you take their best...
I'm a foolish man.
I know.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I was not.
Where's the challenge in that?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Why would you do that?
And this is your "work"?
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
What's it all for?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
What are you?
May I get you some --
Sir --
New Yorkers.
We choose to believe it.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
What's it like where you come from?
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
That's too bad.
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
What for?
How?
How'd he die?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
[Beat] I don't know.
It's Sunday.
No, he didn't.
To the hospital.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
You have nothing to fear, William.
What for?
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
The Jacket.
No.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
I'll manage.
No, I'm ok.
What.
What?
What?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
I gotta go to Little Rock.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Who do you think did it?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Alright.
Tell us about him.
It's him.
A .38.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Who's your friend?
What the fuck is going on?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Good.  That was good.  Where do I go?
Peaches.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Yes.
In the back?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
West.  Left.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I won't wait up.
No.
Well, I just...
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Harlan.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Are you alright?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Does that mean suck my dick?
How long do you think that'll take?
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
How do you stay so positive?
Where?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Then let's not get caught.
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
You sent that?
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Nah.
Well why don't you look her up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Hey, look on the bright side --
What?
Uh-huh.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Huh.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
You got a brew?
Am I?
Yep.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
By the way, what's your name?
Pat Healy.
Some buildings I'm working on.
I work with retards.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Great.
A surprise?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
-- Love story of our time.
I guess.
Huh... that's strange.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
Who?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Friend. Baseball bat.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Why you son of a --
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
I'd go with the seven.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Meaning?
Good lookin'?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Where's Puffy?
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Mary, the man's a killer.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh Jesus...
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
We've got a lot in common.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
We can't do that, Bobby.
Zorin will eat him alive!
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Forget it, Scotty.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Will somebody find out what's going on?!
A murder. On the reservation.
Oh, yeah -- right.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Jesus...
Ray.
I got one up on ya.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
You're steppin' on sign.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Ray. What's your 20?
Do you want a coffee?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
That's a big comfort to me.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
I'm special.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
You're an animal.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
Why?
. Yeah!
That's not what I hear.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Not to me.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
I sit. I think. I play games.
What kind of games?
True.
That's up to you.
Who's gonna win?
I was, later.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Right on the flight line?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
This is crazy!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
But I have to!
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
No shit. The Iceman....
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
He won again.
SHIT!!
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Helping him in.
The wings..
Yes sir.
Then why are you here?
I'm nothing like him.
You may not think so, but you are.
You got the job.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Identification?
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
Come on...put his head in place.
Eight years.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Where?
There!  The woman!
Where's Kuato?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Yeah.
What are you, my father?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Are you saying she liked it?
Come on!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Do what?
And you believe him?
I'm late.
Some men just tried to kill me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
Let me finish!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
And falling in love?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  Mars.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Oh, since when?
The one in the mine!
Aliens?!
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
In a minute.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Oh shit!
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
You are so full of shit...
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Let's assume that it is.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
They're working together, too.
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Not necessarily...
Ah.
No further questions.
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
What, the lunatic who --
-- You found his mugshot?
That's why I hate experts.
-- Roger -- ?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
EXACTLY!
Racist asshole came at me.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
No? Then what did he say?
For control of the prison drug trade?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
I want you to kill for me.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Let's ditch this place and party.
Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
No, sir, we did not.
He didn't suffer.
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
Her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. They are not going to be receptive to the FBI.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
I think that's a good idea.
I'll get my kit.
Faulty wiring.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Maybe.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Laura, I am your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Why do you do it, Laura?
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
What does Bob say?
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Send me a kiss.
What? She asked about my father?
Everything, but everything.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Eating?
Trees?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
Mom... what are you wearing?
Mom, take it easy.
...school's fine...
A special friend?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Bobby didn't give you this?
As if I didn't know.
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years...
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
I know of him.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Huh!
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
I completely understand...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...What difference would...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Yes. I wrote it.
I. Yes. It is.
And you wrote that...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
I'm sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
I understand.
Four. You're great with these kids.
What did she say?
I did.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That happens.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Why?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Is this a bad time.
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What is that to you...?
What are you going to do?
I have to talk to you.
I can't guarantee that...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
It's locked?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
He's not in, Sir.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
It's a long road that has no turning.
What?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
What?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
I bought it for the square dance. I thought I ought to wear some- thing Western.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
We better get word to the authorities and --  Look!
It was nearer than that.
Can I read it?
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
You get any sleep last night?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Chase, it's Dylan!
This is going to give you nightmares.
I like this story.
They were safe and could sleep.
No, I don't think so.  You just have to...pray, or reach...
Right 'cross the freeway.
Coming for you...
A story?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Call it a guess...
When do you think it'll be done?
You didn't jump in.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Yes.
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Do you let your child watch your movies?
My child?  No...but...
Me too.
Not yet.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
You sound so sure.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Claiming their place in the world.
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Yes sir.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Me either.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
What's the difference?
Passport?
I just brought you something to eat.
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
Do what?
How do you know?  They might.
I can't make it out?
Yes sir.
He killed the dolphin.
I don't know.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
He's a big boy.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
You do?
You're officer of the watch, George.
That's enough.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
I couldn't do it.
Shut up donut.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
I'm not staying out here.
I can't.
What makes you so sure it was one?
I can't be sure.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I am accountable.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Twenty.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Whattaya mean family?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Forty bucks...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Hasta siempre.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
You ain't actin', mama.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
In a fire, as I recall.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Here she goes again...
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
Yeah, maybe...
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
It's just another case, Sailor.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Where?
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Who knows, baby?
Uh huh.
You think she's pretty?
More'n likely.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Told you not to call your mama.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
It's a comfortin' idea.
One bad car accident...
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
Yeah?
I'll come along.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
He's the kind liked it.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Yes.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
You need to explain it.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
Yes.
Yes.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
No...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
No.
I know... I remember.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Because... because...
His parents.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Don't touch it.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Call it a hunch.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You did.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
And your wife left you.
Actually, it was her husband's dog...
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
'Fraid so.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Heaven?
You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
I had to. Didn't I?
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
I put you on the floor.
That's a big book you're writing.
Blocked.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Maybe...
That's right. That one.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Even if I end up going to jail....
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Jesus.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Really? That was fast.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
What's he doing out there?
I'm through improvising.
Some times...
I know, but sometimes...
James is... I don't know...
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
No, the dog.
Just kidding.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
When can I see her?
Huh?
Then what? What?!
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
What party?
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Ah, come on.
When?
I'm not a monster.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You don't have to tell me this.
Carlos, I never raped a woman.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
I can't.
I bet you can.
I have friends.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
They grow outside, don't they?
Woodsman?
I was asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It gives me headaches.
No you're not.
Do you have many friends?
Yes?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Yes.
How do you know?
Can't I stay a little longer?
You think reflection is good.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Forget it.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
How old are you and your sister?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
All right.
Are you okay?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
Yeah, they could.
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Is that all?
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
I molested little girls.
Hey, I'm not --
Their power. They seduce me.
They seduce you?
Most people say the odds are against me.
Maybe you should be.
I've got problems.
Piece of cake, baby.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Everything is.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
But you just said that a month was too...
You already know what they are.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
As you wish.
More so than the shark?
And why haven't they left each other?
Then I'll go with you.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
It takes even less.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
What! Get married?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
So, you wonder why?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Better dead.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
Do you consider that a compliment?
No.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
What other boat?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
I'll go and get my valise.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
He talked to you Himself?
Who tells you these things?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
But she watches... she listens.
Yes, of God.
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
They were stained.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I just heard you.
What would you like to talk about.
Who?
I love you.
You've been alone together?
Often?
Oh, yes.
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Are you married?
No.
I can't have them any more.
I've stopped menstruating
What?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Sometimes, yes.
Yes?
She tells you you're ugly?
Are you pretty?
No I'm not.
No.
Yes.
I'm afraid.
Sister Marguerite I think.
What do you do?
Do you remember what just happened?
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
No...
Agnes who did you see?
Agnes, who did this to you?
What?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
If I find anything I'll call you.
When?
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Yes.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
What?
Oh, Dear God...
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
All right?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Hand rolled.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Who is he?
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
She is an innocent.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Hasn't she had enough?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Did you know she was pregnant?
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
What happened to the baby?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Oh.
Sixpence.
I'll murder that Lennon.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Follow your impulse.
I'll look in here again.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Hi, our lot!
No, I'm not.
Well, you look like him.
Aye, but you know him well.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Sorry.
Who?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Nerves.
Clever.  George.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Or something will be able to see us.
Gravity?
I'll see what I can do.
A transmission?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Has the hull been breached?
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Right.
I hope not.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
How's Broussard?
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
Don't be an idiot.
I'm trying.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
My signal's fading.
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
Let's let the machine work on him.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We've got about a week left, right?
Okay.
Look --
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Still worried?
Oh well... you know me.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Good.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
With great pleasure.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What can I do?
Oh man...
It's on the board.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
You win some, you loose some.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
Nooooo!
Just behind us, over to the right.
Couple more seconds!
Thanks.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
What is that?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
And before that?
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
I... I can't!
What time's sundown?
'Bout five minutes.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I believe I will.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
It wasn't meant to be.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
What do you mean by that?
What have you got to do with it?
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
Margo? Lunching in public?
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Of course I knew.
How nice.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Where?
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
It won't play.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Now don't get carried away-
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
It's not nonsense.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
You were great.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Find out.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
Oh, brother.
See you home...
Well?
An answer.
Late for what?
I've heard of them.
You rest. I'll get it...
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hollywood.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Please...
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I'll never get over it.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
Loud.
Margo, again...
What is?
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
I'm glad Bill's back.
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Up in the room.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
What do you mean?
You know, she probably means well, after all...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
That's my Max.
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
I was sure trying.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
And you haven't called him?--
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
When?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I haven't said anything--
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
11:30.
Oh.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Well of course.
I know where Dwight works.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
And?--
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Absolutely--
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--you double-checked both sources?--
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Yes, sir.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Where?
Where?
It may never come out.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
--well, Sloan--
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--maybe I'm tense--
Absolutely.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
I won't talk about the other two.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
A girl. Melissa.
The what to what?
Sorry.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Sorry, coach.
You need some work, buddy!
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
You talked to Stifler?
What?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
I do, baby, I do.
You think she was serious?
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Yes.  Seriously.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So do I, Kev.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Nadia, I can't --
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
You think so?
How?
Just a second!
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
What?!  How do I do that?
I think we're falling in love.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I know. He told me.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
Where?
Well, they are French.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
What?!
Oh shit... No...
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
Why the fuck would I do that?
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
I know, but I had to because . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm not sure but look. . .
Yes, your highness.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
How do you know?
I cursed then all!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Watch me.
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.
Yes.
Why not?
Alvy.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Hey, that was last year.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Well, no... not just, not only.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Oh, you do?
Oh.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Fifteen years, yeah.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Yeah.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Really?
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
That's the key question.
Yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Mine.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Were you always funny?
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Yeah?
M'm.
M'hm.
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
No.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah, where is the spider?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Is he in the bathroom?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
What?
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
The what?
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
May I see your license, please?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
Oh, Jesus.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
How do you like this couple, Max?
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
I was a great beauty.
A long time.
I'm not that good.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Never.
So where is young Jonah?
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Harry called.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
A perfect night.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I adore him.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
You only made half your quote this year.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'm going to throw up.
Really?
Well he can't have gone far.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
You walked out on a five year marriage.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Ah there's our snookums now.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
You must have been a baby.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Why?
Excuse me?
Sally?
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Yes.
The charades.
That was my clue.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
How?
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
Okay.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
What does that mean?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
You're a shit.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Um.  Happy for you.
You don't need to thank me.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Nevermind.
A notch above the storage room.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
The both of you.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
<u>What</u>?
You -- you think I'm right?
Quiet -- sshhh!!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Of course --
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
I...I have no idea, sir.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
...Not enough food?
ARREST HIM!
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
Under the mat? 
I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Sheldrake?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Gin.
You really think so?
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Do I have to?
I just want some fresh air.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I don't want to talk to him.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Mind if I come in?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Yes, of course.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Very clever.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
You threatening me?
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
No.
No.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Good night?
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't believe you.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
You know I do.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Now, Fran --
Yeah, we better.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
It won't happen again.
It's a thought.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
I like all of them --
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Part.
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Sort of.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
A sauciere --
Cook school -- that did it.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
How much is left?
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Charlie?
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
This gentleman or myself ?
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
Wh -- what?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Hairy ?
Who?
What do you mean, Colonel?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Fuck no.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I had immense plans.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Were you with him, when...
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then --
You're Australian?
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Cognac?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Well , who's in command here?
89   CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
43   CONTINUED:
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
I don't want to talk any more.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
What's going on?
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
-- Turn around.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
I'm right behind you.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
It's a spring day...
Where's my ELT?
I already have.

Just passing through.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
They'll have to come right past us.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
Huh?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
No.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
What you did changed my life.
I can't. I work.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Okay.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
This one has a special meaning.
Cute.
Go ahead.
Grouchy?
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Well...
How to die, mostly.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Thanks for looking after him.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Sure thing.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
Because...  ... you love her?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
No.  No I'm not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Probably.
What?
You would be.
Why don't you tell me.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
I bet you fucking know!
It cost us.
Robert?  Robert?
One hour per man.
Why?
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
More or less.
No, they didn't.
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Did it ever bother you?
I don't.
I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
Really?
How was the beach?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Okay.  Then what?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
You didn't take it.
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
Thank you.
Why?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
Are you attracted to me?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
No.
Honestly?
Uh-huh.
Shit.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
Anything.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
And not even then sometimes.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
So?
Tell them we're working for the University.
Thought of everything haven't you.
No....The Asylum!
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, I'll take some.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
So why didn't we?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Did you see anything in the files?
Siberia.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
That one?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Sure. Excellent.
Here's the details.
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
No, not just yet.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Not this time, Kat.
Ah, so what?
Insurance!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
How do I know what's being said?
Am I invited?
Why don't we both forget about him?
It's Josh's.
You will wish you hadn't.
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Well come on, sit down.
You bastard!
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
Some Americans?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Very well.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
-- I like the car I have.
That's over. Way over.
Yeah.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
You do --
Demented.
You.
What kind of a man are you, son?
My act?!
The world of the dead?
That is my telescope.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
You don't believe in anything?
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
You don't miss a thing.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why not?
No.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
I was twelve.
You planned this --
Hoped for it.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yes, one of many.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I will.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
That won't be possible.
So talk to us about something.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Jamie wanted that. She told me.
I'd do that --
Yeah.
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Have we ever met before?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Coming, Eileen...
Oh yeah.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Five cents, please.
Pro! Release the rope!
You were ringing the doorbell!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
A car.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Is  something going to happen Saturday night?
What's going on?
She plays the clarinet, too.
He never bit me.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
They're okay.
Then why'd you do it?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't know.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
First thing I did.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
What is it, Tommy?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
The girl I remind you of.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I didn't drop 'em.
No!  Ditto the professor-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Barton!
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
I...
And what would that be, son?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Well not much.
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Well what do I tell him?
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Yes... Isn't it?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
What do I write about?
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
So they say.
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Yeah, but Charlie –
I apologize, Barton.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Transient or resident?
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
What do you do, Fink?
Would that be good enough for ya?
Excellent picture.
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Thanks.
No.
Thank you.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
Put your hands up!
Yes.
Yes, you do.
I loved him.  I hurt.
No.  Come in.
No, thanks.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
It's not the same thing, is it?
What's it about?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
To see if I can get away with it.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
Did you like her to watch?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
How's that?
Cocaine.
What was the weapon?
Nope, can't say that I do.
Not now he don't.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
I got tired of being played with.
Say what?
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
Catherine told me what was in it.
I'm going with you.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Ten bucks apiece.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
What's wrong?
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
What do you mean?
I'm here.
What?
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You're back.
How is he?
Pretty much the same.
Me? Why?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
Some of them.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
5:11.
Forget it.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
Alright, thanks.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Things change.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
No hard feelings?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
One way to find out?
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
And a very, very good one.
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Coming on line now, sir.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
Keep it.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
But soon...
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
And she did it all for me.  For love.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
No. You said I. I killed them.
What?
How ya doin', Al?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
What's wrong?
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
Wait. You can't go.
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Banzai.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
What?
I said I'm sure he did.
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Yesssssss. I know!
Can't tell if you don't say please.
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
... Murderer...
I know. I called them.
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
How do I know you won't keep them all?
... Where are you taking me?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Great.  Give me a grant.
What is it you want?
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
... Looks like a convention.
I wish you'd...
Finding out where she is.
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
... Behind the makeup?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Great. How??
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
One.
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.
oh dear.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Great news.
Er ... pray tell me why?
Mmmmm...
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Are you?
The TV.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Butt-snatch...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Uh, ten uh...
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Maybe we should knock first?
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>Out</u>.
You're the dead.
Just one daughter.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
No, wait!
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Yes.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Your qu...?  But you're...
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Delia hates it.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Any particular kind?
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
What happened to the people who used to live here?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
An attorney?
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I wish he were here...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
Your family doctor?
I like to watch. This is fine.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Hello, Eve.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
I like to watch.
Hello, Eve.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
... Are you sure you like it?
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes. I like that very much.
Yes. You look very sick.
And I'm Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I understand.
Yes. That is correct.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
I understand.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
I never needed money.
Is his back feeling better?
... I see.
Which view?
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
How were you paid?
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Yes, ma'am.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
No! He's a real gardener!
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Very good, Your Excellency.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
No problem, Chief.
So...? Where the hell is it?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
It's that serious, huh?
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Oh yeah, he's good.
John Makel...
I never played a jewel thief.
Tell your friends.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
We have to make it an early night.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'm scared.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Don't crowd me, Craig.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I love you so much.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Simulates?
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
No.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
The Great Mantini?
Why are you being like this?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Never heard of it.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Whatever you're having.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
Say the Word!
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
I don't. I have my own.
Yes sir
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Go upstairs I said!!
Mama?
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
You sure?
Better ask Paul D.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
For what?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Paul D.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
She left me. She's gone again.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Uh-huh.
But I guess she told Dieter.
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
That is for the urn.
My rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Thank you, Donny.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
I'm not really, uh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Mm.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
He fixes the cable?
Now I got--
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
From who?
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
Hey man--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
What the fuck is going on there?
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
Thanks Walter.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Come on, Walter!.
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Who is this?
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
All right, get out.  Both of you.
I said out.  Now.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What about Nomak?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Why?
I don't like it.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Human?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
From his father, of course.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Not that I'm in contact with.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Going on twenty years now.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
No, we can treat the wounds --
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
Watch me.
Who is LaMagra?
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
It worked, didn't it?
Look closer.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Blade --
How long have we been driving?
I'm not leaving without you.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
LaMagra --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
How?
--which she may have--
Hey, folklore--
Don't know--just that she was afraid--
Closer.
Let's talk to your husband--
--Nick!!
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--bullshit!
What'd you dream?
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
--no, I think they're all in there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Four in the morning?
--which'd be about ten bucks--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Yeah?
No idea--goddamitt!
Yeah. Me too.
--Domini!
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--turn the goddamn camera off!
We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--oh, Jesus--
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Then I have no idea.
Elly Kedward?
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
You're needed here--keep watching--
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Could I tell him what it's regarding?
His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
I am?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah.
I think someone's watching.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Yeah...
What's the matter?
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit.
You owe me for two weeks.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
Nobody knows you hired me?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Right. Sorry.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
What do you want?
No.
Lie down on the bed.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
Then don't talk about killing.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Please. please stay.
Hello.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I'm doing it.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Sometimes I think I do.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
That sounds good.
O.K.
Okay. yeah, call.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
You saw a lot in one night.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
No.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Okay.
Frank!!
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Well. Okay.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
He what?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
It's garbage.
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
The coca is my responsibility!
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
And I only deal with you?
Barbara and me.  No one else.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twenty-six months.
Because they caught me?
But you must.  It's the only way.
I know.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Try the back bedroom.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yeah, well...
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Good.
That's where you belong...
I meant every word of it.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Hello.
Pablo said no?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
She did that before.
Where are you going?
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
What?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
That's right.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And here?
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Sid Ahmed.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Of course. As soon as possible.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Here?
Why?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Because it hasn't all been erased.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
The official cause?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
No -- never.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
Yes.
We were lovers.
I had a bad heart.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
She didn't.  She just left.
Why do you think she left you?
What did she say?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
She was.
Yes -- several times.
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
I was angry.
No.
Yes.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Then you would have gotten your money?
You didn't know about it before that?
And she left shortly after that?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
Yes.
Why not?
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
It's not my taste.
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Yes -- she did.
You take a lot for granted.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Tonight we open new doors.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She allegedly humped him to death?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
No, Your Honor.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
This is not relaxing.
I'll talk to him later.
What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
SO!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Well, I can help.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
Mom's orders.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
What?!
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Don't say that!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
That's it.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
WHAT!
Francesca.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I doubt that.
But I... We don't even know each other.
She starts sniffing me.
Then what happened?
I don't think you're normal.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Yes, that'd be nice.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Stop it!
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
Then he can move! People move!
But now that you have it -
Where you going?
Hmm?
What's she like?
What happened?
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
Yes, they are.
Yeah?
Just some flies.
Spooked?
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Let me see your hand.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
We met.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Lucky thing.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
But --
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
Know what?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
They just left, didn't they?
It was him.  I'm positive.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
The money?  The money's gone.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What happened to them?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
Everything you couldn't.
But everybody is all right.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Good idea.
Five.
Where is it?
What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Caesar, you still got the money?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
What do you want?
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Basically.
I'm already in your bed.
Shit, here we go.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
I don't.
What you heard wasn't sex.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
Even though he knew about you?
Yes.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
Yeah.
What?
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Who is Gino?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
I won't.
I think we're going to find out.
What happened?
I'm here, aren't I?
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Forget it.
We don't know what we're into!
What is Treadstone?
I think so.
So now you know.
That's all I get?
I don't think so.
We have to go home, Jason.
Right.
Yeah, I know...
Paris?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
That'd be great.
Oh, Jesus... 
You don't want the police any more than I do.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I don't know.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Looks familiar?
I guess so.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- let me do this, okay? --
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
What?
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- I'm on it --
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
... yer ducts.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Beginner's luck.
Long time no see!
You remember Alison?
SAM! What a surprise!
How much do you know?
Not much.
Enough though, eh?
Not really, no.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
So how ...?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Trust me.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Bastard!!!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Why not?
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, terrorists of course.
They'll be there waiting.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
What happened to you after ...
Information Retrieval.
Really.
What a BITCH!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Here.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
You remember Samuel, my son.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
I ... uh ...
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you for calling Cen -
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Fixed?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
The pace?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
He looks like a cop.
He flipped out.
Mary said you might be coming.
Got a beer?
You're going to live.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
The first is always the best.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
I think this place stinks.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Promise you won't go inside.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
I need a drink, that's all.
Backup?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Look out!
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
You learn that in the army?
Yeah, you're right.
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
It's not loaded.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Okay.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
Then what was good about it?
Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Sit down, stop.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
No.
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Yes.
I wish it were you giving the story.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
...good-bye then.
Okay, sweetie.
No.  Not even you.
Why so glum?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
So great -- right?
One year...almost one year.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
Yeah?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
Well...
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Through the closet.
I'm sorry.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
Are you nervous, Walter?
I already told you I'm not.
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
I'll pose any way you want.
Anything new?
Is the manager cooperating?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Walter, I'm sorry...
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
What are you doing here so early?
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
I admit it.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
I know, man.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Well...
I don't have another cat!
Never mind...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You can cut the crap.
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
You are?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I ain't going no place with you!
Turn around!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Here here!
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
Andy!
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
You were having a nightmare.
You broke up with my machine?
You want some water or something?
Where are you gonna go?
No, you're not.
For the dance.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Well, where?
Cafe Blase.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Sporting events, yeah.
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
My nails.
They were vampires?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Watchers?
It isn't important.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
B'bye.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Could be.
Throw it out.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Wit-tay.
Okay.
Well, look who's here.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Like you've got a grip.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
What?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
A little better.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
Yes I do...
I think you're real cute.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
That's great!
He's a virgin.
We all deserve to wear white.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
Aren't we all?
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
Annie, I think you should leave.
Who?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
It was a cocksucking call!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
How?
Gimme that.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
Go for it.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Let go of me!
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
My right.
What?
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Okay...
Jim looking for somebody.
Where does he go?
Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
You were wandering around.
Yes, you were.
You got it.
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
Yeah.
Honey, come here.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
In so many words, yes.
Listen...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
No, I don't wanna come -
Yeah?
Yeah.
You lost your control.
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
What - what, Caesar's?
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Yeah.
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
No problem.  Sorry.
Half of everything is mine.
Ace, listen to me.
Well, sir, I was just...
Why is she eight pounds over?
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit...
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
What is it?
Oh, no.
Who's this?
Thank you.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
No.
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
You didn't have to beat him up!
You can't make me stop caring...
What? What?!
If not for me, at least for Amy.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Get out of here!
What'd you have?
I had a... salad.
Mm.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Get - get up!
You get down here!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Not gonna let me in?
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
Mm.
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Hey!
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Is that the last one?
I'm over here now.
What're you gonna do?
I'll tell him, Remo.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Ma che cazzo!
That's enough now!
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Yeah.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah, no shit.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Oh, come on.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Bye.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
Nicky, please...
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
Do you know that?
Here.
He called you right here.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
He's sittin' by the phone -
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
You're driving me nuts!
They checked in alone.
All right.
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Of course.
Hey. This is Shelly.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Yeah, what's to stop him?
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Take it easy!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
I'm positive.
You're a little confused?
Again!
I know, but that's enough.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
You have to dial nine first.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
We'll hunt him down together...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
She has a real spirit.
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Even the skylight?
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
Spear.
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Yeah, she's okay.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
What?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Maybe.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Thanks.
Where do you think you're going?
Taking messages.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Did you have to tell her my name?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
That's your "rep."
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
My name is --
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
What about the others?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
No.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The one in Brentwood.
What do you mean?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Yes sir.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Include me in that.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Whose money is this?
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Did you hear that?
Ask them.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's your point?
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You mustn't hang up.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Pass.
Some loyalty.
Sure.
Just relax.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Negative.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
We're gonna get there first.
Where's the backpack?
Seems not.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Undercover.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
I'm sorry.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Yeah?
Nice.
Hi, Jimmy.
I would expect he does.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Did I?
What?
Scottish?
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Where?
Why?
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
Didn't think I could.
Tell him it hurt --
Apologies, my sweet.
Sure I do.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
Should have stayed a girl.
Not at all, honey.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
It's a secret.
And you wouldn't leave me?
Sorry. What you doing?
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
You knew my Jody?
Don't you want to kill me?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
You do?
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Fergus.
Please, Dil --
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Leave me alone, Jude.
I know.
So you did fuck up.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Why would you do that?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
You sure about that?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I thought it was Dave.
And who is she?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Can't.
Only joking.
No?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
You want to bet?
Can't. Once I signed up.
Best game in the world.
These things take time, Fergus.
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Don't know her.
When I was a child...
Stop that talk now --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Got to catch me first --
You shut your face --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
What?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Lord, you're stubborn.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Thanks very much.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
No.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Open it.
The view had better be worth it.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Reggie?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Which one are you?
Come here.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Hm?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
The shower's in there.
I dare you.
Shut the door!
I don't think I know that one.
Well!
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
And if it is?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Leave me alone -- !
Stop it!
I'm very confused.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
What should we give him?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I found it! I found it!
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
Shakespeare never said that.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Instant divorce you mean?
I don't think I follow you.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Be careful, Peter.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Ok!
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
You are upset.
Who is she Daddy?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
She's not here.
You know where I can find her?
St. Michael's.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
No, you couldn't.

Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
You know about that too?
Of course I'm scared.
I really do. For your own safety.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
I was desperate. It was gross.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
I can't right now.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I did.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
Yes!
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
That's not why we broke up.
Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
Hi princess.
Don't make me order you.
Who was the fourth?
So are you.
What?

INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
That's right.
Probably.
We worked in Chinatown together.
Honest?
That's too bad.
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No.
What about her?
Where is she?
Haven't the faintest idea.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
No thanks.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
You sure this is okay?
Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
And why's that?
What's the maid's address?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
An accident?
Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
You left your keys in the ignition.
A check?
I have?
How did you find out?
He told you?
I mean I can't tell you.
You were seeing someone, too.
Yes... why?
No reason.
I don't believe you.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Oh.
No.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
And Hollis knew about it?
It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Doing what?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
Your eye.
Just... I have to.
The Albacore Club.
Including the death of your husband?
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
...That's not what I meant.
Where's the girl?
I want to see her.
No...
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
What are you saying?
...so that's why you hate him...
I'll take care of it.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Don't know her. Take a number.
Oh, good.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
I don't understand.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
Yes...
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Apple core?
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Neither do I.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Then why don't you change jobs? 
No...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
No, nobody came. 
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
We've got a nice plant here.
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm sure that's it. 
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Hmm!
You're no Venus de Milo.
Thanks.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan!
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Where'm I going?
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
It's been a tough day.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I mean I've got a job for you.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Go ahead.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
She was going to leave you anyway -
Brad, you are drunk.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
Maybe you could remember something that -
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Good!
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Yeah, but not in here.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
So you're really getting married?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
I just told you.
Jesus, you're caustic.
But can we date?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Let me take you out tonight.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Um... okay.
It wasn't me.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Oh God...
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
She thought it was me.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
What's your point?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Did you tell Veronica?
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Return of the Jedi.
All right, Vader's boss...
How do you mean?
It would stand to reason, yes.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
The milkmaids.
The milkmaids?
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
FUCK!
See? There you go again.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Number six.
Why not?
I swear.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Who found him?
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I don't want to talk to you.
If you must.
You're bullshitting.
Really?
Because I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
I think four.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
As if it's that easy.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
It's hard to swallow.
Why do you say that?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
They are not.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
I'm not dealing.
With you? I don't think so.
It's not my store.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
So I'm told.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
I touched a nerve.
Twelve.
You're a pig.
Three.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It stings a little.
WHAT?
You said you were here all day?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
Feel that.
Well, how about these two movies? 
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Which one?
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks?
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Surprise me.
Bags?
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Take the gun.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
Nice and easy...
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
He can handle it.
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Yeah, let's go.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Take the rope.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
It looks like a winding route.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
Give me the fucking code!
Richard Travers.
Appreciate it.
You bastards... bastards.
I've been cured.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Try the wine!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Yes. They want to help.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
How do you do, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
It's alright, thank you.
Do you feel that way now?
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Surprise?
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Aye.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
No, brother. What d'you want?
Let me get up.
Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth is faster.
Travel...and things.
But not now?
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
Jesus...
'Fraid so.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Not our call, Phil.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Let's not get excited, sir.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Why not?
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
It's not me.
Two...
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Okay, try it now.
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Why?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
I never learned jazz.
I'm not catching a melody.
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Any special reason?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Motive?
What?
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Pretty scary, huh?
Who are you, Jerry?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
So what's the question?
Please put it down.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
You will?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Thanks.
This way.
Connecticut.
He gave it to me.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Love at first sight?
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
I'm sorry.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
<u>Liza</u>!
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Excuse me?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
We're very specialized.
Terminal?
-- Understood.
Tell me about it.
Jonas?
What do you suggest?
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
You're --
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
You know why I'm here.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
With me.
You mean --
It'll just take a moment.
What?
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
It's beautiful.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
That isn't the way it works.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Mmm.  Look closer.
-- of Hadden Industries.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
That's what they all say.
Sounds like a Russian general.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
But what about your research -- ?
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
Can you try?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
I'm sorry.
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
But --
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
Cut that backsass!
I'll make it a dollar.
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
I'll give you fifty cents.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
On my own.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Like I always do?
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
That fool. That damn fool.
Cuter.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
He was lying.
When he was seventeen.
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
In jail.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You're calling me a crank?
That's an opinion, not evidence...
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
How do you know that?
Work with me.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I'm giving you Clint outside.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
She on the passenger side?
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
Did you come?
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Are we imagining it?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
You're kidding.
Yes.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
It's hospital policy...
What?
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I miss Beast a lot, too.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
But everything's OK?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Do you think I should?
I've already made arrangements.
Not even if it's something positive?
Just remember that I love him.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
I wasn't hungry.
No.
Really?    Me too.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I wish I could have seen that.
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Open up.    I want to see.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Really?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
You, too. Kick ass today.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
I think I should call someone.
And all the plans we have.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
I'm calling in sick.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Forget I asked.
You just need to get more organized. L
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
He's a patient here.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I'm really sorry.
Office work?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
You'll never get out of the city.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Should I call you back?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
What for?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Has to be.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Some bread and...
I will.
Guns.   Can you get them?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
We had a deal.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything.
Everything?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
Cool.
Oh, you think?
I don't know.
Thanks.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Stick around and find out.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then leave her to me.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
I'm just playing around.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
No, not yet...
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Well, we had talked...
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Shu Lien...
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
I'm buying.
They make you fart.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
I saw it, too.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
I should be trying to stop you.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Mister Funboy lives there?
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I don't know you...
Do you know what you destroyed?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Your pain ends now.
Leave me alone -- !
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
18k.  Crap.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
Leather purse...
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
You heard me.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
You don't even know me.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Yes.
What are you doing?
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Need any company?
Oh please.
I do.
No?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
That's not fair.
Yes.
Good for you.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Any ideas who it could be?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Well do you like him?
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Well did you like it?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
Prude.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Would you please leave.
Who told you?
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
And you think she bought it?
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
I see your point... though why should I care?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Care to make a wager on that?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Even there?
Okay.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
With who?
Mock, mock, mock.
And that's why you're leaving?
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
I accept. Now get out.
War it is.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Well please leave a message that I called.
I need to talk to Annette.
Did she show up?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
Irena.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
What do you mean?
You do that, Edward.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It was on account of the birthday party.
They ran away.
Yes, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
You called me by my name.
I'm your friend.
A princess?
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It's a pretty ring.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Will you come soon?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Yes, yes -
I can't do it! I can't do it!
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
She pleaded so to do it
Mom!
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
Translation: a total geek.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
I wonder if he's married.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
I still thought it was a purse.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
I've been here. What day is it?
Oh no.
Why not? There's been a murder.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
So pee? Here?
You never say that.
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
Yeah?
On your desk.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Are you following me?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Yeah. Maybe.
Goodnight.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I know. The important thing is that it stop.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, take it.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
We can just take this pillowcase.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
And you think I'm sick?
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
This one walk you home too?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
How could you have been so stupid?
You wonít regret this, sir.
Well be more careful, please.
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Not that.  Anything else.
What is that door?
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Water?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
How do you know I'm innocent?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
A month.
No...
I'm... not... nobody...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
Fine.
Clean.
I don't think so.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Dave -- I'm working.
It's fine.
This is undeclared income.
I'm not sure.
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Oh, yeah... probably...
A teleprompter.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Fine.
Perceptual?
Yeah.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
Certainly.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Oh... Yeah.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
It's just so strange...
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Look.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
Come on!
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Yeah.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Except sex.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I think you're sweet.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
You are?  She's glad I called!
I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Don't stop!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
I don't know.
Good luck.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Yes sir.
What is it?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
But if he said no before then...
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
It's my birthday.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
I'll come to the performance.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Not an option.
Did you clear this?
Just trying to get to my boat...
I'm not rich people.
Quite a few.
Keep tasting...
And what if I run into one of those things?
This time, make an exception.
Joey...
That way.
Nowhere...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Fucking women, man...
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Good... Pass the beer.
Fuckin' A!
You're full of shit.
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
It won't open.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Everybody love Linda.
Thanks.
Too bad.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Vince!!!
Oh, Jesus.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Naw, it's... I mean...
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
You're going hunting?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
This is horrible!
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Well, where's he from?
From Nam?
Promise! You gotta promise!
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
You wanna bet?
Here! This is it!
Then lemme have 'em.
That's it. No. No way.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
What's that noise?
What?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
What?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Did you get one?
You didn't get a deer?
Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
Never one.
The fuck I did!!!
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
Avon Lady!
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Good night, Wade.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
You never want to find out.
Take a look at this.
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
Yeah.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
What's your name?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
This little thing says I can't.
Belle --
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
And what about Daniel Webster?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
No, Stone!
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Afraid ... of what?
-- of what happens after we die!
I do -- and I think you should too.
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
I'll get it, Jabez.
Consarn the consarn --
Hard luck -- like me.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Coming, Ma.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Me?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Cup for cup!
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Not any more.
Ellis, what have you told them?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
Only if New Jersey counts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Sure.  Follow me.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Listen.
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
They're not after you, they're after me.
It looks like a whole roast.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Do you still want the operation?
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Give me the keys...
Well, they go to guard school.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?

I'm not going.  I'm okay.
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
What about Howard?
It was on the TV.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You shouldn't start now.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
All right ... let's go.

That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I want them all.
I have to see.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Maybe...
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
<i>$300,000.</i>
What about your toe?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Be kind to your sitter.
Something is going down. Something bad.
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Real good.
I be.  I'm living large.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Have you noticed something about them?
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
I don't know how he does it.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Is it a good morning?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
I'm working.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Nice!
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Yeah, me too.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
And move to Long Island...
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
That's my name.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
We both do.
You don't know shit about shit.
Mookie?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Meda.  Meda.
Later.
You're still late.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
Ya like him, huh?
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
How do you know this?
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?
Too many pizzerias already there.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
You know Mom, like in the pool.
I know I am, Mom.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Shift to your left.
Sounds like a pirate.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
HARRY! Here he comes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
No. What happened?
A turd.
Hello, he only invented money!
No. Look.
Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
Well, I'm listening now.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
You know I do!
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
And you are great in bed.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
We felt his presence.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Yes.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Why do they come?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
What can be done has been done.
Did they try and fail?
They tried and died.
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Who do I play?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Formaldehyde.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Perfect.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
And who may you be?
It's that easy?
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Better than not getting a job?
I thought he was dead.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh, just like in the script!
That's ridiculous.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Like <u>what</u>?!
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Raising money is tough.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh, hi.
Not good...
Huh?
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Huh?!
You don't wanna be noticed?
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Al!!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
No, uh...
A woman wants to be pursued.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Who?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Send him away.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
He says --
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
And what did he come back now for?
Oh God. What hospital?
So you had sex with him?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I batted!
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Okay ...
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
What do we have to do?
What are you drunk?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
I'm doing all right.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
You watching the ballgame?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Please!
Ray, come an--
Me?! That's you!
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
He likes it.
Yeah, just --
You guys have fun?
Dick.
All right.  I'll be back
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
I know.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Yeah.
You'll be fine.
Just wait outside. Tammy.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
And when did you do it?
I don't believe you.
Still clear?
Yep.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
So?
Well, I do.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
That obvious, huh?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Yes.  But do you know?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
It's Lynn.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
So tell me about it.
In the morning.
No.  Now.  You fucked him.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
How what, Wendell?
You've got it, Wendell.
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Of course...
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
More.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Gone.  Not a trace.
But you were business associates?
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
No.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Glasses.
You make a mistake?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What?
Of his penis, sir?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
When?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
A sweet man.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
What'd he say to you?
What do they have to do with this?
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Move it.
I didn't use my name.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
<u>Here</u>?!
No he won't.
Goddammit--
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Are you sure about this?
With what?
I'm married.
Very good.
I'll say.
What size?
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>What's</u> your point.
The robbery.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
About what?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
No.
What?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Sorry.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
It wasn't me.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
What happened to your head?
Well...yeah.
Stacy--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
That's gonna end tonight.
Not that much.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Other than me.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
For the last four years.
Tell me about Brill.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I'm sorry about that.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
--otherwise we may have to--
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Brill.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Where's Stacy?
Where's mom?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Who won the fight?
Just be cool.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
I need help.
Tell me about it.
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Yeah.
What?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
We found the originals.
There was a transfer.
Lyle?!
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
He said - be careful.
I believe you still have my book.
Now.
It's a folk song.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Shall we be all right?
Don't do this.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
We've got to get you out of here.
Don't talk.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Could I trouble you for some water?
If I could just see some identification.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Which we've overflown twice.
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Where've you been?
What if I told you he did this to me?
What?  How could he have?  When?
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Me?
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Off with his head!
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Aren't you?
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
Yes.  Dropping off.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I don't think it's indifference.
Would you like me to?

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
I try not to expect you.
Then come with me.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What are you talking about?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
The windows don't open.
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Yeah. Me.
I'm in the middle.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
So alive.
Well, no...but...
Maybe I should drive this time.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
That's because I wanted them to!
Let's just see how we do.
Charged?
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
To our...partnership.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
It's your mistake.
I always knew you'd do the job.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Where the money is.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
A parting gift from the Empire.
There's always a surprise.
Parachute.
Packed.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But that's all behind us now.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
They drive so recklessly there.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
But--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
Always in a rush.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
In the van.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We're supposed to.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
She's calling the shots now.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
All of 'em?
Which one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
What's your point?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Good.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
What medical records?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
Find out.
That's crazy -- why not?
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
You're not gonna be there.
Fuck Kurt.
Erin?  What are you --
I did.  Both.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
You see your office?
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Take it.
Corey.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
It happens all the time.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
In the conference --
Well I hate it.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
I do.
Right.
What?  But you been working so hard --
What do you want, a joke?
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
I need it.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
I will.  Bye.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
What?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
Next week.
Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
The Emperor?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
I can help them!
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Yeah ...
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Or you ran into something ....
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
That's quite a compliment.
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
Never heard of that system.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
Are the coordinates set?
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
But I feel The Force flowing!
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
But tell me why ...
I see a city in the clouds.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
And I too.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They suggested oranges.
What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
What?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Not you?
I'm here.
Does he know how to activate it?
Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
I said pull over.
Later.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
You need help.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
The freeway.
You're running out of time.
Thank God.
Who ain't?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
So be it, to the death.
It is deep...
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
He has given up.
We are to blame.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I?
You didn't ask!
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Fuck it.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I didn't know that.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Phonograph.
Me too.
May I ask...?
We still don't know.
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Could you see her?
Like what?
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No.
Well I think you should.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Here I'll show you.
You like him.
Hi Father.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Stealing is a sin.
She seemed fine.
Sure.
Who's in it?
No.
You and Regan?
Uh Huh.
In time.
There's only one.
But deliver us from the evil one.
Amen
Can you give her something?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Yeah, a fall.
That's to bad.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Yes.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive.
Your pay.
Twelve years.
Just the same.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
Oh.  What do you do?
Twenty years, Ma ...
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Really.  You sleeping?
Why the interest?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
It's more than that.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
This time you gotta go.
Your older brother.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Get out of here!
She's here.
How about these?
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You recognized me.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Two years ago.  March.
Right.
Yeah.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What?
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Just until we find another girl.
I don't know. Some disease.
Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, we're not.  Jack?
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
All right.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
What do you mean?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Miss --
I sing now?
When we know.
That!  You can't wear that!
What's wrong with it?
I wear a seven.
Zip me up?
You're a prince.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Did you hear it?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Virgins?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Is that important?
Uh, well ...
I'll call you.
How come?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
And you don't?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
The Stratford.
I guess in case one year they're not.
It's okay.  Last one.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You sending me home?
You're kidding.
Yeah... No.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
What are they?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Older than me.
Why not?
Ever go to church?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
He hit a guard.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
My place.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
Should be.  It's yours.
Or reactivated the first one.
Like ...
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
I'm late for surgery.
Something good?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Would it?
Go on.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Castor's escaped!
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
What?
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Just following your example.
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
What's that?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
-- Studying.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
I don't know.  Maybe...
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
A broker? Really. And now you’re in the tire business?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
It’s okay, Alan. I get it. I’m in your shoes, I’m thinking exactly the same thing...but here’s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it’s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they’re gonna send their kids to college.  It’s just people...
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
Where’s my real dad?
Who did?
That’s where you work.
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
It’s not Kate, is it?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Why not?
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
How’d you do this year, Tony?
All in one tape?
I know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
...my feet are hurtin’...
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  C’mon, take it off.  We’ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
What...?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
Are you sure?
And now...?
That’s a big one for me, too.
Way out...
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Hey, are you okay?
Christmas?  It can’t be Christmas...
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Solid.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
We're working as hard as we can --
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
Don't you wander off, boy.
And you can?  Power it up?
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Is it safe?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
Ben!  Ben!
Johnny.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
It's been changed.
Excuse me?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
What in the world would give me that idea?
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
The less time, the better.
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
What're you getting at?
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
How bad off is he?
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Where can I get a cab back to town?
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Yes, Cora.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
At an operation?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
That makes two of us.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
Then don't drift down further.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Whoa, Daddy.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Officer Olson.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
A subconscious-type thing.
Oh, man!
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No. No, ma'am.
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Know who this is?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Stan Grossman called.
You told me about it.
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
No, that's okay.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
I'm sorry.
Nope.
Nope.
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
Linda.
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
We've got a -
Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
He's at -
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
I'll ask the questions, son.
Sure.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Yeah.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don't know ...
Please.
Here.
No.
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
I'm sorry, but I...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, everyone.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Surprise me.
The fight.
Show-off.
Yes, I promise.
That was three times you promised.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
Fucking sweet.
I'm not asking you to.
What's this all about, Tyler?
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
The house is rented in your name.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
Yes.
I think this is about where we came in.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Look at me...
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
Pleeeeeease!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
So let's do it.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Taken care of.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I guess so.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
He's not a witch.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Thirty-nine.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Get out! Get out of the car!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
I know who you are.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
What just happened?
There's the Mekong.
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Ninety.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
There's a compass in the handle.
I've seen worse places.
Fermented fish sauce.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Duck soup.
Crazy motherfucker.
I couldn't get you in.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
What's the job?
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
What?
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
Can you walk?
Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
But now it's free, right?
Yeah.
Well did you or didn't you?
Got any more bread crust?
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
I... You're not going to understand this.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
No.
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No...  He is supposed to live there?
He's not here.
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
No, I have to work.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes.  They're free.
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Funny -- you look married.
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
The Red Knight!
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
In a bar called Hellfire.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
You're married.
Divorced.
You have a disease.
A wig?
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
You'll be gone, period.
What the hell is that?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Palm Apodaca.
Five'll do it.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Am I on TV?
Hi, Tita.
No kidding.
He's had two strokes.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
I know.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
A couple of months.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
You don't call that music, though.
What?
I don't believe vou.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
No, the last time was three years ago.
Is she?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
It's a Borzoi.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Pardon me?
Yes.
Look at me.
Not now, I'm busy
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Alright.
What are you doin' here?
A play-ya.
How you treat them?
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
I can't man, I'm punished!
I'll be right down.
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
Pitt.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Eddie from Compost?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Sonofabitch.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Your aunt?
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Breathe easy...
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
No idea at all?
Like tonight.
Affirmative.
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Can I get you something?
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Till then.
Whoops.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Of course they are.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Why not?
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Who?
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Deal.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Down boy.
It's amazing.
Are you still in love with Alan?
What is this?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
You can't do that.
They're trying to kill me!
Lock's busted.
I commend him on his choice
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
So you're saying she moved out.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Get out of here.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Not really.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
I said, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
So you...
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Right away!
Exactly.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Peachy.
People still watch that?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Forget it.
Twelve pack?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Yeah, go on...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Go on, another time, another place.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
What about Don?
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
This side.
Well try, okay?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
I wasn't looking.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
... Salvatore?...
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
S'right.
Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Let yourself in.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Third time around.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
You know what I'm saying.
Well, I think you do.
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Hey, bud.
Well, why not a little of the King?
You alright?
You give him his drops?
Wish you weren't.
Okay...
So am I.
The future guy?
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Do you know where I found this?
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Uh huh...
29-years ago.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
On the job?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I'll warn them.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
What?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
What the hell is that smell?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Longbranch...?
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.
Sullivan?
Where are you going?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I don't know...
I vote for me.
Sure.
You go ahead...
Your bed.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Somebody was in here.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Whaddya mean?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Daddy, what is going on?
Uh...yes.  But...
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
No.
We'll scare 'em right back.
But what I get scared again?
Yeah, we're here.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Skin stretcher was human.
The what?
Yes.
Twenty.
Look --
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
You need to leave.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Get up!
That's what I'd like to know.
That's all right.  I was just...
Her name's Stephanie.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I didn't kill her!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
Never.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
Really?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
Yeah.
No.
We have to get off this ship!!
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
Yes...
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
I'm not!!
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
Asbestos lining.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Paisley Porter.
Classic.
Does it feel comfortable?
I hear Alan's sick.
She's dying.
She died.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
It can't be all that personal.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Daddy, wait.
First you tell me.
Brilliantly moving.
A flat-out hit.
What do we want?
What else?
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
That's very lovely actually.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
I know, Pop.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
How come you got the kid with you?
Washed away.
Because life is good.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Why does it matter?
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
What about my play?
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
I have excellent long-term memory.
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
Yes.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Say it again.
One more time.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Well, we shall try.
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
What was he like?
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I've never spoken for anything else.
We must end the campaign.
I hope not.
A great deal.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
That's when you take advantage.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
All right. Fine.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
Who are you trying to convince?
I like football.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No?  What's keeping you?
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
German.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
A day or so.
They found my eyelash.
Where?
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
You may as well invite her here.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I'm travelling too.
Antonio, the choir...
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
You worried about the cost?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I was at home.
I know about you.
You'll be next.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Who are they?
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
Good.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
You sent me to him.
She's on TV.
Texas is a big state.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Not now.
We got this far.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
You and me.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Yeah.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
No, I'm not.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Where?
You were with him?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
What do you have in mind?
Not now.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
What did you do?  Albert?
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
Though nicer than most?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Oh, do you?
While he was here. You went about together?
Could you do me a favour?
Especially when I play the lead.
Tell me about the girl.
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Was it Albert?
Then he must have pulled her.
Your brother? What you talking about?
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
They said he was drunk.
Right.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Yeah.
No. Really, I am.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
I'll call the police.
Ta-ra.
That little shit!
Do you want breakfast?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
No. Are you tired?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
They're friends of mine.
Jack Carter.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
I'm not?
We're stuck with this...
It's not right.
No.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
That's right?
For some sales pro...
Yes.
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
What act?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
What?
Yes.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Did you?
He'd give me a job.
Why?
Do you need five grand?
Is that what I just said?
Because you listened.
Yes.  They are old.
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
That's great.
Thank you, George.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Levene!
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...no...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I can't do it, Shel.
And what if you don't close.
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
Somebody broke in.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
What does that fucking mean?
What are you trying to tell me?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
You're so full of shit.
I...
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Shit.
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Last night, this morning.
Guess who?
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Uh...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
Kenilworth.
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Yeah.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
I told you.
We're going to speak to her.
She told me I have to.
What, "this"?
It's nothing.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Mountain View.  Eight units.
You hear what I said?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
When...
They took 'em...
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
The...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Your contract went out to the bank.
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
Will you take me?
I can help you.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
What if we don't pay?
What can we do?
Connie.
Tom is right.
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
I've always taken care of you.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
I'm going to see my parents.
Am I a prisoner?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Alright.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
No questions.
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
Goodbye, Michael.
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
You haven't heard me.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Who's asking?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
Let him gamble.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
It's important.
We worked it all out beforehand.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
What's to be jealous of?
It never crossed your mind?
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
The Master is waiting for you.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
What do I do?
We have his note.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Mornin'.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
Huh?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
You went to university?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
It's new.
All righty.  I understand.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
What happened?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
David produced her last picture.
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
No.  Definitely not.
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I see.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
You are much too human.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Hanna.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
She is beautiful.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
No.  I expect you can't.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
I don't mind.
Quite.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
You didn't?
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
Kip.
You know my back.
What do you want from me?
Double-meaning intended --
Right ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
What's that?
Yeah.
Hey, Donny --
It's arright ...
Yeah...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
I think so too --
Oh, for God's sake
What do you say, Toby?,
You, too
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
About what?
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Price of doing business...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Come here -
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
I gotta get my tool --
Now, we go -
Hospital.
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I think so... They're just... So ...
No worries ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
She does have one thing you don't.
Of course. Hi, Junie --
Tell me...
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
What happened to Sway?
Who's "Eleanor?"
Billy, how are you?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What bag?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
With what?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
What did he say, exactly?
Jimmy.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Oh, Morgan!
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
Ah, history I think.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
You want us to give you cash right now?
Codebreaking.
That's one aspect of what we do.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Of course.
--That edge!
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
I don't know what it's called.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
I need someone with your kind of background.
You too, Gerry.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
--I'm not angry at you--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Me too.
Where're you going?
I got one of those too.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
What?
Nautilus?
What does?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
What?
I didn't ask for this.
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Here's my number.
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Okay...
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
They don't come over here that much.
Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
I guess so.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
What?
Yeah, but how do you know?
I don't know. I just feel it.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I'm not honest?
No, you don't want to hear that.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Okay. Go on.
Can all of you work?
But--but how we gonna eat?
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Have a little snort?
It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
That's our place.
What you figger to do?
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Can't you see that sticker?
Oh!
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
You been acrost?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
Hush!
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
No'm.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Are you crazy?
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Won't they ketch us?
Please don't.
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
You people looking for work?
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
--No.
Don't say that.
To make a long story short...
It's nice to see you again.
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No time.
It's something I do...
I was leaving.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Not bad. You?
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
I don't think so.
Yup.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I'm not happy.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Fair enough.
No. You drove us here.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
How did you get this job?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Five years. My son was born here.
I don't care! We'd be together.
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Doesn't matter.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I don't care.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
Don't they believe in signs here?
I'll take care of it.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Why should they?
Hi.
Yes. We're suing.
Exactly...
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
How are you feeling about work?
Let's not talk about that now.
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
They fired you?
Frank's a good man.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Diane!
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Ain't brain surgery.
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
We should be fine, then.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Mmm. An editor.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I want to watch.
So?
No, not yet.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
You shut up, stupid!
Oh yeah...
Long enough.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Dragon book. Compiler design.
I want it.
Super hero like even.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Yo, hit the lights.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
How did you know that?
Okay. Let's go shopping.
It's too much machine for you.
Name your stakes.
And if I win?
And you have to smile.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Cancer?
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey, it's me.
You think they're going to bust us?
Virus?
Pervert! What are you talking about?
So?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
What number please?
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
What does that mean?
Can't you find somebody else?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
How many bodies did you find?
Drive Carefully.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I can't sleep.
In a second.
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
I can't.
I've got you come on, go down.
No.
All right.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
I don't know.
Jamie?
Its not over yet.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
He shouts, too.
Fun-ny. See you.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Cute.
Okay. Bye.
Of course.
That's probably all he can do.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
No, he's not.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Sure...
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Is Annie around?
Sure.
Sure.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
There is no such thing.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
HURRY!
Was it the bogyman?
There's nothing else I can do.
I'm wasting time.
Are there any special instructions?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mm-mm!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
We're actresses.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Ohhhh!
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
No, I don't have time.
Well, sure.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
He's got like six gold records.
Yes, he's just adorable.
What are you doing?!
I have been in love with you for so long.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I almost didn't.
Oh, my God.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Lee...
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
That's where your talent lies.
Why not?
I want one with you.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Yeah.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Hmm?
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
What are you going to use for money?!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
No.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Hello?
No.
Why?
No.
Really?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
That's really nice!
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Oh, sure.
Two thousand dollars.
I should get a garter belt.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
He's such a loser!
Really?
Look, everything's going your way.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
My--uh...
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah.
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh!
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
God.
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...you don't have to think.
A reward...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Then I'm doing fine.
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...nightmare.
They got that kind of money?
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Why did he come back?
Seen what, sir..?
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
Awright.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
I won't take much of his time.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
Try Barney Clark.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Shut up, Starling...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
What'd you say, hon...?
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
Waal...
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
I require...
Where do you live?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what?
N'not <u>that</u> sad.
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Because...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
And why should we believe you?
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
I don't <u>think</u> so.
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
What is your point?
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Shut the fuck--!

Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Geez, don't listen to them.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
S'okay....
You're not funny.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Did not.
Did not.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Come on through.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
sighs.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Him . . .
That . . .
God, yes!
That idiot boarder?
Let's go overseas . . .
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Mummy!
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
I miss her. I miss my wife.
The way you just looked at me...
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Getting paid for doing shit.
Really? Do tell.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
I've been in here before.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
What?
Really? Why?
I only married you for your body.
It's perfect.
No please make yourself at home.
What?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Music to my ears.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
YOU!
I know a guy who only has one leg.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Right.
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
It's November.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
The homeless!
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
You never saw that picture, huh?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
John, I know all about it.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What's "cynical"?
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
Reporters don't have hormones?
How are they with kids?
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
No, no, no, no.
Who doesn't?
Uh huh.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Here, take this out to the table.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
What's that?
Stop knowing me so well.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Can we keep him?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Talk to me about what?
They appear to be authentic.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
He had to come from somewhere.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Most people are afraid of death.
Who are you?
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
Sometimes.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
You look like you have.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Not unless they're immortal.
On the back it has--
Conner?
I don't think it is a duplication.
It will not end tonight.
It's not for me to decide.
I love you, Conner.
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
No.  The money, please.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
It's happening right now.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Like what?
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I got the gasoline --
Okey-doke.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
Keep your head down.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
Go, Chief.
Go, Chief.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Yes.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
What do you mean by that?
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Will you protect us.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
What do you mean, General?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
Our cards, please.
I need a great favor.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
So where is the lamb?
No, no.
A kiss.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
A Volkswagen.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
How dead?
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
-- what was he doing here?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Yes.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
And we get this money when?
Best of a nightmare.
I'm better than that.
Why?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
We're safe?
Run.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
Then who are they?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Rewind that.
Then who did??
He must've beaten us all here!
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Melissa...?
Sara...?
Something....happened --
-- I'm coming --
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By freeing them.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Who...is Colleen?
Yes.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Take me to her.
I want this one, daddy.
Must be...
You didn't think much about that before.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What about the other five percent?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
So what should we do, father?
Good night.
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
I know what I saw.
What will he do?  What does he want?
Where?
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
I'm trying to quit.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Fuck you!
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Rutherford Auction... that name...
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Get em....
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
That's what you theenk.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that shoe you lost...
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
If you think you're getting past me...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Why George, you big softie...
The Hipster!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
I'm sure I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...You do?
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Your i --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Consider this my resignation --
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
What the heck they doin'?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
And Sid says you stole it!
But Buzz --
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Wait a minute!
But, sir!
Oh my God, sir!
Damnit, where's my car!
Well... I'm for it...
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
Old Faithful.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You don't believe in it?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Wait. I want to listen.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I hated her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
You want to go?
Rough day. Good night.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
That one.
What's on your mind? Don't --
What do you mean?
If you're going to insult me --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm fine dad.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
All right.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Nothing.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
You know, dah--
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
It's what?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
It was lovely!
Well, we can talk about it.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Who?
We were just riding around.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
You're not a psycho!
Oh Wendy.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Forget what?
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Where you going?
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Am I right or am I right?
No!
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
No one.
Sure, anything but this English.
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Tell Sandy? What?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Huh?
Watching what?
Right.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
All my model planes.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
You never tasted the stuff?
But there wasn't any...
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Okay.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
What time was that?
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's asking everybody questions.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
You heard me that time.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
How should I know?...
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
My arm!
Congratulations.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
If you want it to be...
Yes, and very beautiful.
Ah! You have questions?
Listen to me.
She is.
Yes... My God...
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
And yet you knew what I would o.
Stop her Louis!
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
I took your life. He gave you another one.
He'll never let us go.
The swamp...
Still my beautiful child.
Yes...
But how will I ever know, Louis?
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Yes...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
As did the one who made me.
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You can't look at them...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
You loved your wife, surely.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
He did it to make you stay with him!
Sorry. Emergencies only.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Don't even think about it.
Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I've got to see.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Will you try...for me, please?
You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
Yes!
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
No. Yes?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
How's the water?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
Well ——
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
But why?
In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was —- perhaps it was.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor Cathy --
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
Whet do you mean?
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed — everytime you can't get your own way.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
I shall not leave the island ——
The General threatened me.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Who?
I hate to do this, fella.
What did . . .
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
Made what?
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Zuzu's petals.
A boy?
Yes, but George . . .
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Mother . . .
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Give the flower a drink.
It will?
Uh-huh.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Goodbye, Sam.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
No.
Well then, how do you know?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
In that place?
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
How's that?
About what?
Would you rather leave?
My baby.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Sure, sure I am.
Oh, shucks . . .
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
You bet.  Hang on....
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Please.  It's my job.
Every day?
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
All of us thank you, okay?
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
The whale's mouth?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Right.
Good.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
That you were fired.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Perfect.  Look at this ---
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Great!
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
And second?
No.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
And a missing man.
Honey, I gotta go.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Yes.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
What's up?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
... Mean through the tubes?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Yes, you can.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
But you --
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
Let's hope he knows that.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Just watch it when he does.
And I like you.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
Get ready to go.
And big for his age.
'Preciate it.
Thanks.
Massachussettans aren't.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Goes up.
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
Hey.
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
No, South Georgia.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
... I'll go to McDonalds.
So was Dad.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Watch me, Grandma....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Thea was attacked by a shark....
It went away....
We'll be there....
You check it....
You're silly....
Good night, Daddy....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
You just got here....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I don't know how....
No one does till they learn....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
A big one....
I have my own little island.
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Just like that?
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
What's that....?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
I made them, man....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
Gave them the day off....
When I got the grant.....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Hoagie.
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Screw you, Jake....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Be my guest. What you got?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
Not too good in daylight ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
We're going.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
No .. You didn't know that ..
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I guess by the bed.
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Maybe he's lying to you?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No.
You should. It's wonderful.
Have you known her long?
I know.
You know? How do you know?
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
It's not possible right now.
I'm blind because my father drank.
Yeah, I guess I do.
What does that mean?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Oh come on --
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
It's all going to work.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good evening.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Okay... I will...
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Thanks.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
No, I'm saying to be --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No, I don't know.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Not a chance.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Jerry --
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
What'd I say?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
People change.
Nothing.
Eric...
Eric!
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
When did you have it last?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
Sure.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
They never got that big.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
No. I couldn't see.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
That was about a year ago.
Possible.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Oh, my God.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
I think she's with Sarah!
Look!  Sarah!
So that others would know about this place?
Funded by whom?
No.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
John....
Look.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Sattler.
The - - agility.  You're right!
We were right!
Yeah, I know.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Thank you.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Machines hate you?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I know.
What kind of opinions?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Ray, start the tour program.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
What?
Yeah?
You have a map.
Who's there?
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Cute waitresses?
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
In a manner of speaking.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
A true friend would do it.
Did you see him?
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Was he depressed?
-- You should meet my father.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
It's gone out so quickly?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
I could always apply there.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
What's to become of us now?
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Father ... Father!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
They' re dead.
Native costume?
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Coz of something I lost.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Here please.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Oh no, I don't think --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
What about everything since?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
What're you gonna do next?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
How can you do it to yourself?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
My bed.
What?
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Go down in my room.
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
It's got to make sense some way.
How is it back there?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Welcome to the... 
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I hate it.
You mean for good?
Good night.
Dad?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Sustained.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
And yet you fired him.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
I don't recall.
Yes.
So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
I don't believe you.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Three months.  How can you tell?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
I don't know.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
What?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Yes, Holiness.
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
It is alright, Father.
No.
And you have horses? You love horses.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
No!
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Thank you. Please sit.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
No. This war is almost over.
Can India help us?
Britain?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
Where is that?
In the Americas.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The people will not allow it.
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
What do you think?
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
You cannot.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Keystone what?
No!!  Out!
They don't really attack underwater and--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
He never said "go".
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Are you sure?
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I beg your pardon?
Good.
'Night.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
You calm down!
Look.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Probably not.
They look like they're jumping.
So does he.
Other than to eat us?
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Yes.
Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
I got nothing against--
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
<u>Apologize</u>?
Yes.
What?
Wait.
Me too.
The somebody else part?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I want you to go there.
Part of our research--
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Myra.
Thanks, Ardelia.
I will... I promise.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Oh.
I think we may be, yes.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Murdered...? How?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Why?
You seem pretty sure of that.
She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Five... so far.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I didn't.
No. You ate yours.
And the questionnaire...?
Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
I - ran away...
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
And - one morning I just - ran away...
What was it?
Yes...! They were screaming.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
We leave in the morning?!
Absolutely.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Thank you so much.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Yes. Yes, I will.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
I am sorry, Duncan...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
Ottawa!
We don't.
Then what?
...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
What did you see, Major?
You forget yourself!
And what is that?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Fire!!!
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
France.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Was there such a thing?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
That's an order!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Twenty minutes...
Not yet.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
What was it?
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Hardly.
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Yes?
No Harry, you can't.
Good job, Chris.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
All right, furry muff.
About twenty minutes.
All right, Kenny.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Hit the fuckers.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Right as rain.
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
What do you mean, me?
I'll only be a minute.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
And?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Lives and learns doesn't one.
What are you doing, Plank?
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
That's going on optimism.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
Six.
What do you mean?
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
Leave your sister out of it.
That isn't true.
Yes, sir--
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
You're dismissed.
We were just dancing--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You're testing me?
A .45--
So?
That's not the point.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Yeah, well--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Both.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
So I'm part-Indian?
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
We should just do it.
Substance abuse?
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
You get much of that in here?
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
What's in the back?
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
We have a daughter.
We don't need a new jail.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
He still living?
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
And the ten thousand?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
I never said that.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
And my father?
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
That was the night he disappeared?
What about it?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
You gonna stay out here?
Time marches on.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Well, you were working there--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Want to take a walk?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Most people did, yeah.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Nothing.
So what are we gonna do about this?
More, I hope.
I've felt that way, yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
You'd do a good job.
So when did Buddy leave?
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Who?
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
D'Amour.
He's a priest?
It's him... it's him.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
What is he?
Yes...
Will you come to him on your knees?
He's with us... He's with us...
Yes.
You don't?
And you don't ask questions?
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
No.  Not yet...
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
It's one in the afternoon.
What's the difference?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
What?
Harry D'Amour.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For an introduction.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
He deserved it.
And you're not?
And you believed him?
Looks that way.
Fuck.
Try.
Call me tomorrow.
One question.
Yes! Yes!
No!
I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
Yes.
Liar!
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
No, how about you?
Ok.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Oh, for her show?
Four.
Fuck off.
Do you ever see him?
Well, I mean it more now.
Hi, Bob.
Yes.
Take them.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
What are you talking about?
What?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
What?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Ok.
Why do you have to defend her?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Uh...sure...I...what?
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Peter, are you okay?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
He will.  He has great faith.
You have a sister in New Orleans.
Something he said, just before...
He spoke to you?
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Just open the door, please.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
You just call?
Peter Kelson?
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
What do you mean?
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
I can't eat before a game.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Maybe she is.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Don't curse.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Thanks.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
It's okay.
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
No one's forcing her.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
You do.
Yeah, right.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
But?
What's up, Sidra.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Oh.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
What?
Right here.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
You want to go talk?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
What are the doctors saying?
I forgot, "Q-man."
Figured it was something like that.
Thanks.
Find.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
So?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
He tore his ACL.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Okay...
Lucky kid.
And some things should never fucking happen!
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
What's wrong?
I'm here, I'm listening.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
He's not my boyfriend.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
baby, please, please --
About two years ago.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That's great, thank you.
What's that stand for?
yeah, good, ok.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Well...is that illegal?
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Eight o'clock?
Billingsley's?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Well I don't go out very much.
No, no.
You really use strong language.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
It's fine.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I'm sorry --
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
You alone in there?
Diet Coke.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Have you ever been there?
Son, don't --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
That's confidential information, little man.
No Can Do.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Finish it up without the lip.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
What's up?
What happend?
Do you have love in your heart?
What?  What does that mean?
Might of been before my time.
Picky, picky.
You see?
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Braces?
You don't need braces.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Yeah.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
Get a girlfriend.
Who are you gonna call?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
....getthat on the tv....there...
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
Muffy -- coffee?
It's all important --
She lived in Tarzana.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
Is Linda here?
Uh. huh.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
yeah.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
And what about screaming?
What's this, how did this happen?
I went out last night.
Did your wife find out?
All your other fluzzies?
What happend to you?
You want her right now?
It'll take the pain away.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Did you ever touch her?
But you can't say....
<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.
No.
She's asleep.
You're her boyfriend?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
Where will the money go?
What does that mean?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
What would you like?
Thank you.
Maybe.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Should be one-thirty.
Why did you do this?
hang in there, ok. I love you.
I have money.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
No, M'lady.
He is your brother!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Shut up, knave!
You can do it.
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
About to hang himself, I should think.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Athos, my friend!
To kill the king.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Whose rooms are those?
Your mother's.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
You may go, Lieutenant.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
What do you need?
You mean shut your ass down!
Did you report it stolen?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
OK...where do you want to start?
1490...Breckinridge...
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
I wouldn't presume to try.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
How are Molly and the boy?
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
'You're very beautiful.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Why not?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
You.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
No.
What's it narrow down to?
This is our boy...!
What?
It's happening again, Jack...
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
What's being photographed?
I'm fine.
Yes...
Are you a man?
No.
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
No.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
Uh... sure...
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
I don't want to do that,
What happened to them?
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What would you call him?
No.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Do you remember what you said?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Can you quit?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
I want to see you, too.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
You went in the apartment?
She got all right?
Stuart is fine.
Very interesting, even to a layman.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You're insane.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
May I keep the file?
I haven't decided yet.
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Fight what?
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Twenty!
I don't wanna talk about it!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
I can shtop whenever I want...
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
And you're just poor white trash!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
I'll take my chances!!
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
So your name's not Gorsky.
I used to think you were original.
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
What's your name?
Yes.
SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You don't, do you?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
You killed them.
No!
... Yeah.
How many were there?
Yes.
Right now?
... Yes.
Your training.
Because... I didn't think I would?
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
I need the main wet-wall.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Who?
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
How do you know that name?
That was a long time ago.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
Is it?
What did she tell you?
I'm coming with you.
Do what?
No.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Guns.  Lots of guns.
You're not far from Cypher.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
You got sparklers?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
I understand.
Don't be smart.
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
How much?
Hostess?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Ok.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
 Shut up.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
He's cute.
Hi, Allison --
I know you do, darling.
And you could care less --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Do they, m'dear?
I wasn't going to say --
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Right away.
What 'business'?
I didn't say.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Thank you.
"Death and Taxes"?
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Do you think I need a haircut?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
What are their feelings?
I know.  Gum up the works.
Joe, you do get around.
Are you?
Yeah, that's what he said.
He said that?
I from dat nex' place.
Make it time.
Nuthin'.
Don' need you okayin'.
Nothing?
The Board is waiting.
It's so very nice to see you again.
How did you meet?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
No.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Not now.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
And is your heart beating strangely?
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
More than you love peanut butter?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
I believe that, don't you?
Yes, that's why I said it.
Hold me --
'Threw' you?  Where?
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Yes, Bill.
That's what everybody says.
Yes.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
This part I'm interested in.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
What's okay?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Then what is it?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
I'm sorry, I --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Thank you, Quince.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
Hi, honey.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
You like him, don't you?
Uh oh --
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
You're not listening --
Yer damn right.
What?!
Will it?...
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I agree --
Why?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
Yeah?
You did.
Take the money and walk away!
It's isolated.
Yeah. You?
Yes.
Where is he?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Thanks.
How do you know about me?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
It's good.
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
I'll be waiting.							   *
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Fucking hope not.
From who?
Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
How do you know this?
How do you know him?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Why would I do that?						    *
Sure.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
When?
Right now.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
She's dead...
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Cost less.  That's the point.
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
And what do I do with him?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Chill out Sonny.
Then you should.
This is Agent James Fujima.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
To recruit you.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
On the phone.
...and thanks for the flowers.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
I had to lay eyes on you.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Alonzo...
Must be some mess back there.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Yeah, oh yeah.
I show you what problem --
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Sounds like they knew you.
What?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Get down -- where?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You got it.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Is he all right!
Getchmis...?
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
...He had a bald skull and...
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
KNOCK IT OFF!
What?
Ziat!
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
How much?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Yes.  I think so.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Be tough on 'em.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
What did he do?
That doesn't seem so bad.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
What?
Oh shit.
You can't take anything seriously.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Jeremy...
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
What?
Oh, Jesus!!
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
--my number one fan.
Following me?
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
If you wouldn't mind.
No, what is it?
I guess that means it's okay.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
Then who did?
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Show me the way?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
--not fair?
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Nothing.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
I'm going to play my records all day
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
It will.
What things?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
That's nice.
He's your client, huh?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
From her point of view or mine?
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Magic...
Mmmm.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Exactly where is she?
I am. She is.
What can we do' mate?
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- right..
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Listen to what?
They've got a book for everything.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Can you think of a better one?
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Affirmative.
Oh Ethan!..
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like what?
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
She must still be on the property.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
They'll kill me.
You're right, of course.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
What about him...?
What kind of show.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Roger that.
Take off your God damn coat!
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Who is "they?"
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
This stuff is so sticky.
Theyíre dead.
Are you damaged?
One hour.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
The arms dealer.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Information.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Mm - Hmmm...
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
We're not outta here yet.
Higher.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
Why not?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Sure.  If the main character does.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Connection denied.
What?
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
You haven't said anything.
You look tired.
Yeah.
What killed him?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
Yeah.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Let's go tell your Mother.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Let me come and talk to you.
You don't have to help me.
Bus hit him.
Why what?
I don't know.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
I'm telling you your life!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I've got you.
I can't do that!
Why not?
But he wants me to come!
What?
Thank you.
Awful?
You're late!
I'm really afraid.
No.
Yeah, I'll be in.
What do you mean?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Then let's set the date.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
You have a brother?
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
What! How do you know?
He's with his dying mother!
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Alright.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Did you see the moon last night?
Yes.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Of course I want to.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Do you have a girlfriend?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
What you don't know about women is a lot.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Oh. Right.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Bring her forward.
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!

Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
... and you'll come and get him.
Yes?
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
Oh, I see,  Right.
You are in great peril.
Please ... we are doctors.
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
I'm getting dressed.
Get out.  Out!
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
I hope to go up next year.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
It is quite late enough.
How will I know what she requires?
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
This is a slur on her good name.
I wouldn't know.
Surely --
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
I heard something.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Yes.  Yes it was.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, several things.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Why not?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Ma'am.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
He?
Why don't we take this into my office.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
We are talking...
It's twelve-thirty!
My house.  I want to try something.
Like the fractals?
What?
No I'm not...
Yes I am...
Don't even say it.
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Thought so.
Is that your question?
I'm thinking!
You have no time.
Sign me up.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Howdy to you.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
Okay.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
What?
Yes, there was.
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't know who I am.
"So... surprise"...
No... but...
Thank you... thank you very much.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
This Denny's.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
What's going on ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Yes.
Girder, watch your head.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
What ? Are you my mother ?
When you are ready.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
He's been expecting you.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Yes.
Thanks.
Yahoo !!!!!
Nothing.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Suspended from school, my mother??
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Okay thanks, atta girl.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Have fun.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Maybe he's hungry.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
I'd like to, thanks.
I told you it was a long story.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I've got something better.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
That's okay.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Hi.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I won't.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Get married?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
And I thought I was weird.
Does it work?
Boyfriend?
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
In the tar??
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Yes, it does.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
You know how I feel about you.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
You're telling me.
Hey! Oh look.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
This guy bonking you?
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Yes.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Deceased.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
Well the other night at dinner...
It's no big deal.
Oh, how do you mean?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
No, why?
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
In ages, I know, me neither.
Yes.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Any more soda left?
I love this guy! 
Can I go too?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
What do you get for that?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Please.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Have you ever tried any?
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
I will I promise.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Oh no!  UUH.
No, I don't wanna.
Hey, where does it say that?
What?
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Duck!
What?
Do it!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
I have a suggestion...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
When I'm talking to children.
You like her.
Go figure you.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Try less appropriate.
Ben Gay.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Manicure...
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
No.
I've missed a step.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Only.  If he wants to.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
... that this is all my fault?
I love him.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
I need you.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
You never eat when you're despondent.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
Yes.
And your point?
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
Shhh.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Come on.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Green.
She's going to rest now.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
Barbara Jean.
Okay.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
National?
She's in Paris.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Need a ride?
Get in.
We don't mess with accessories.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
When did you start singing?
Well, can you tell me why?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
I'm here.
I don't know who you are.
Fifteen minutes?
It's me. What is it?
Money's no object.
Hello.
Glad to meet you.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
Ah... Peter Finch.
Is that good?
You serious?
Oh, why thank you.
Yes you are.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
Susanville, Soledade.
By all means.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
It's video.
Yours.
How 'bout Manson?
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
Then was it worth it?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
I'm sure we will.
Yeah, we have a van.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Yes.
NO!!!
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Yes.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Where do the air ducts lead?
The entire wing?
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
But you'll never be whole again.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Two guys?
Three.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Yeah.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That's right.
Well, what d'you know?!
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Thanks.
Just so you do your work.
Okay, thanks very much.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I been there.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How about another beer?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
How d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Four.
How about it?
Well, what d'you think?
My kids want me to teach them.
Don't look so scared.
Well, I haven't come around.
They won't.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
I don't think that'll happen.
What's so hot 'round town?
Like a home, for one thing.
What 'you signifyin'?
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Who're you?
Well, what're you going to do?
They'll run you out.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hi.
No. Why?
Since when?
No. I only needed the code from you.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
You son of a bitch...
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Did you trace it?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
What are you talking about?
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
I an' I, man. I an' I.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
We got problems topside.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Case.
No!... No...
Why should I want to meet him.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Couple of months.
Almost two days.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
Go ahead...
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Nice.
Yeah. Let's do that.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
You stood for like a month.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Kristen got a quote?
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Dude, you rock!
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Cool. I'll catch you later.
You said that already.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Really?
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Don't look down!
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Oh--yikes!
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
I finally found my story.
Who are you guys?
If you went away, what would become of me?
I can't help it.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Taste it.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Where's Jesse?
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
Shut up, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Let me look at your eye...
Who?
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
C'mon, cut it out.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
About what?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
What is it?
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
I'm not hungry.
Huh?
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Making friends?
All of them.
Thanks, Mom.
First door up the stairs.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Don't hold your breath.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
He's close...
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
That was different.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Can't be good news coming from you.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Sorry.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
I've heard crazier things this week.
I beg your pardon?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Now you're lying.
Films mainly.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Yes.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Okay.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Busy tomorrow?
What did you say?
She left me.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Big feet -- large shoes.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Stay forever.
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
You disappeared.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
The truth is...
And what would you say...
Nice surprise.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Yes.
Yes -- sort of...
That's nice.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Right.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
No -- did you?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I believe I have.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
What?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Tell us about it...
Who? Tell me!
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Oh, I had them removed.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
I hope everything is settled.
Thank you, ma'am...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
Marry who?
M-M-M-Mack?
It's okay, kid. Everything it going to be okay... I'll come back an' getcha in a while... 'Kay...
God Bless America.
No.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Hey, what's that?
Did to me?
Lobotomy?
You heard me the first time!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
I'm busting outta this place.
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
No!
No!
Just wait till you hear...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
That's a dime, Martini.
A nickel.
Me, too! Me, too!
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Time out!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
Shhh!
That right?
Okay. Who else?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Are you a doctor?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Big man!
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Take you han's offa me!
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
What?
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
Your mother.
Buona notte.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
What's she doing?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
We found each other, didn't we?
Exactly.
Okaaaaayyyy.
No.
But Faith--
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He's safe.
Why are you asking me this?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Where's Positano?
I'd really rather not say.
Yeah.
I don't know if that's such a--
No.  Are you're leaving?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Uh huh.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
And more...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
No.  He's never asked me.
Why don't you ask him?
Yes you did.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
What about your job?
I have vacation time coming to me.
Does Dwayne know about this?
My God, you have...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Live happily ever after.
Maybe.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Oh my God.  Where?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Larry, did you rent a car?
I thank you.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
He missed me.
Sorry...
I'm gonna take her home first.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mm—hmm.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
The point is— there isn't much time, kid.
See! You don't understand!
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Oh she's a beauty.
No thanks... .
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
I got my whole life to drink.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
Edie...
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Your gun.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'm just resting my feet.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
Sure... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
I told you lay off.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Aw, Johnny... .
Now just a minute, I—
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
What do you mean?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Don't let them hear you.
Be careful!
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
You do?
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
Ahh, she will be yours.
Well then let us proceed.
You better hope there is.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
Who is it?
Tell me, how do you do that?
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
Just hung up.
How long you talk to her?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
You know how I felt about her.
You find out?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
How are you, Raymond?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Who was the friend?
Glenn didn't tell you?
I thought everything.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Someone down here?
How many was that?
That's funny.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
Yeah...
Really.
That's my dad.
How do we do that?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
You think he's lying?
I see better with them on.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Any time.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
It's a big house.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How are you, Richard?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Can I do what?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Why would I do that?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
No.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Technically.  They're separated.
No thanks.
Dad...
We don't get to talk much any more.
No?
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
No, like...
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
Power dive!
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
What's there?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Boxin'.
Yes'm.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Peggy Sue!
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
On what?
And nothing will ever change that.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Who?
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
What?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Come back to me.
What, why?
It must run in the family.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
What're you doing here anyway?
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
At my age? Don't be silly.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
This morning was good.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Why not? They're my favorite.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 
Rosalie Testa!
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Sixty—forty.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
What will they be made of?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
So are you. You've got a vision.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
I... um...
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
What do they do up there?
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I'll be fine, Dad.
It sucked.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Bailey, Brackman.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
A reaction to AZT...
I am relaxed.
We're not skipping this treatment.
No.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
A carrot?!
Little baby girl.
Kids are great.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
Nine.
We?
As in, the vegetable?
Rayisha.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Uh huh...
I've considered that.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
Not unnecessary ones.
Gay movies.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Why are we going to do that?
Get real.
Were you pleased with his work?
We were satisfied.
I might.
Get a life.
That's perfectly clear.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Think about what?
One or two.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
I would try for them.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Probably right.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
So what happened? Where are they, then?
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
For your own fear.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Some prophet guy?
Frightening thought.
We're all on the same hajj now.
You <u>don't</u> see.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Looks clear.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
What, it's broken?
Shut up.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
That way.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Try telling them our names.
I want her.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Yes, I can do that.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Of course.
Okay.Up to the cave.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Why not?
Yes, Sir.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
This is his assertion.
Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What?
I got one...
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Dawn...
...beautiful night.
What you got there - beers?
...there's nobody.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I really don't know.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Okay. You win.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
How careful should I be?
Possibly, Miss.
Bank?
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
As I said before...
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
You don't know who he is?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Why?
Nothing matters.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
Mine?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Because you think your in love with me?
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
I can't answer that.
I know that.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
What's a buzzer?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
I don't.
Thanks.  I don't mind.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Doesn't answer the question.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
How about Magruder?
Ye have, have ye?
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
That's not very kind.
It's kind of you to see me.
Well, we were just...
Penfield.  James Penfield.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
I see.
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
...break away completely from--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
No.  I'd want to--
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
And you're at this third stage
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
I have to be up early. 
In radio we're different.
I haven't really thought about it.
What did he want?
To the airlift.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Come on.  Hand over.
It's shit.
You approve!
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
You're so gross.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Yes, finally.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
That's good.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
She said that?
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
No.
What's their program?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Once.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Okay!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
But you're not alone.
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
Surf conditions okay?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
Got it.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
I'm serious.
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Sure.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
What?
Warm them up.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Go on.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
We're going to need everyone.
I'll take him.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
They never are, dear.
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Stolen?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
For an hour.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Do you plan everything?
Always.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
... dollars?
I sell them.
Vivian --
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Dinner can wait.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
He died a long time ago.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
It was a business decision.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
We're letting them slide?
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Okay.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Oooh, I love those.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
I swear it will be done.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
But what if something happens to you?
There will never be a need.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
What?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
I could kill you now.
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
And a good thing too.
Who's Guilder?
I'm waiting!
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
-- where?
I hope we win...
I'll be right back.
Yeah. It's really good.
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
I don't understand.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
As you wish...
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I swear it will be done.
Yes.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Begin!
That would be inconceivable.
What?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Oh, have it your way.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
Yeah, an hour.
Have fun storming the castle.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
What did I do?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
I'm not going to jump on you!
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
What is it?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
No kidding?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
But he has long hair!
I don't know.  I don't know.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
I shall count the minutes.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Bismark...
Hindenburg...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Oh.
Look at the picture. Please.
The following morning. Sunday.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Cash.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Who are you, friend?
Must've needed it.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
Of course not. Please.
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Okay. If you'll come along...
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
Just what he told your detective.
Lila.
I want to know if my sister is here.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Yes.
No.
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
An hour! Or less!
Why can't I go out there with you?
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
She always tries to be proper.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
Los Angeles.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
I'm sorry.
No need to apologize...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Haven't any.
Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
Leave me alone!
Shut up! Shut up!
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did she talk?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
No?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Horsefeathers!
No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Cry-baby?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
Heaven knows. A lot.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
But I have some friends waiting.
Thanks.
I'm heading out of town.
It's an experiment.
And glow happily ever after.
Where is she?
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
I do, too.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well, a little.
Well, yeah.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Yeah.
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy, that was my place.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
A wonderful woman, boy.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
You think it's that good?
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Lay off once, would you?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Save it.  Just go.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
They shot us all, kid.
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Oh... okay.
It doesn't say that.
It's go time, Billy-B.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
No, we're stealing.
Speak for yourself.
Nope.
There'll be other chances.
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Yes, sir.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
I... I think I can... clarify...
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
All for one...
Sounds good.
How'd we do?
I don't think so.
It's one of a kind.
I can't kill my own father.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
You love him, don't you?
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
All right, hang on.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Proper?!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
We shall double our efforts.
Oh, no.
Your father?
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Yes.
How many languages do you speak?
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
A decision had to be made.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
From Transexual Transylvania.
That ain't no crime
No no no no.
Oh, lucky him.
Creature of the night.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
I think it's closed.
By accident?
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
You sure?
I should leave.
Don't tease me.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Paulie!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Few minutes?
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
That's it.
Ya still light seventy.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
A few bucks.
Gonna try.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
What?
What?
What was I gonna say?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Think about it.
Ya puttin' me on?
'Bout an hour ago.
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Whatta you get outta this?
...Shrewd.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
It ain't your locker no more.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Help what?
I'll do okay.
Gazzo's a good man.
What can I do about it?
Maybe --
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Check the scrawl.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
I'll bet.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
I didn't know who I could trust.
He's right here in the...
He made me laugh.
Wait here...
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
I've already seen your photographs.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Leave Me!
A challenge, on my life.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Of love?
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Hold Daughter!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
[Within] Juliet!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Well, what was yours?
That dreamers often lie.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Duty calls?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
We'll double your price.
Bad company...
There's been a slight problem.
What's that?
I take it you still want the money...
Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Not exactly.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Not for long.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
You should learn a little patience.
I asked if we could give him anything else.
There is that.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
And what job is that?
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
I'm going with you.
Do what?
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You would have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Business keeps you on the road?
Would you stop with that...
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
That's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?
Why didn't you kill him?
I want to get some hounds down here.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Hell, it won't be us!
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
What makes you so sure?
That's right!
He saw everything!
Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
Not bad enough to kill him.
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
He killed her...
And you're solid on that?
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Two thousand...
I want my share. All of it.
None of us like it!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Denning was wearing a bug.
He's irresponsible.
Nothing.
You deserve it is the occasion.
That son of a bitch.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Well I just uh, you know...
No, I can't say that I have.
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I don't know...
I can't hear a word you're saying!
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
What?
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
Two-hundred thousand!
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
I don't think so.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
Don't look at my ass!
Who died?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Why did you help me?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
No.  I'm going to find out.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
This money is evidence.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Excuse me?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
No.  But I'll help you.
OK. Say what it is.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
So was I.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
It was not my intent --
I know a shortcut.
Shortcut?
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Where'd you get it?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Do it!
Can I speak with her?
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
It's Griffin.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I was trying to find the right time.
Good one!  Thanks.
It happens to be how I feel.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
You know, your daughter seems...
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Cindy the manicurist.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Yeah.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
Am I what they had in mind?
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
It's delicious, trust me.
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
You couldn't.
-- it was a betrayal.
About what?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
"I want to meet you..."
Turn on your radio!
Thank you.  I love you.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
Made for each other.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Magic.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Mom!
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And you're worried about him.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Your only hope.
I don't get it.
I don't know.  Do I?
You're right.  You better hope so.
So I can go.
Sure.  Looking good.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Bye bye blackbird.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Perfect.  We'll be there.
There she is.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Yes.
This is the one I like.
Get out.
Sure.
It takes time --
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
It never ends.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Later. When I finish the ironing.
What has it got me, your union?
Never... never... never!
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
You weren't waiting for me.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You like that?
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Go ahead.
Then leave.
You don't understand.
Because he'll kill me.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
I try.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
It's me.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
What?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Palmdale
I think on account of his nose.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Hey, check it out...
When? When did you ever see me use?
Good for you Jimmy.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell me what?
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
I was talking about Miles.
Really?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Yes, sir.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
As a matter of fact, I am.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
The hell he didn't.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
To each, his own.
You know classical music?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
You don't count.
I changed my mind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You?  Leading a squad?
What about the company?
Uh, Captain...
Since when have things been normal?
Nope.
You never know.
How about you shut up and take your position?
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
You want me to take over?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Yeah, how so?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
HERE THEY COME!
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Here they come.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Lingerie.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
And your former wife.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I'm gonna call her.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Read it.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Oh yeah!
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
I know that.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Alright.
No.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
That's cool then.
So what's your job this summer?
No.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Oh.  I was putting the...
How do you know what I'm going to say?
We'll see.
It sounded like you did.
You shared it with a dick.
No.
Did you talk to Corey?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Did you tell anybody?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Then don't do it.
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
One more time would be nice.
Good to know.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
No, really.
I know.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Dude, I can't do it!
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Hang tough, Lloyd.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Yeah.
You know Diane Court?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I love you man.
What -
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I pay you too much.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
How do you do?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Yes.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
That's okay.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I'm inquisitive.
Can we talk?
You could start with an apology.
Not until you’re dead.
And much richer as a result.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
You’re not going to get away with this.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Tails.
Tuition’s expensive.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
I know that.
That's not the way it's done.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Where is your attacker?
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have to watch rehearsal.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The young girl is slashed again.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Thanks, Joel.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
But she's standing right next to you.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
You are so not funny.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
They've got her!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Someone stole Sid's file?
I'm on duty.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
But you know who she was.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
What the hell are you doing?
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Who's this.
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Hello.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Duh... that's quick.
You know it.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Yeah...
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
She looked dead. Still does.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
You know that's not true.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
What?
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
What number are you trying to reach?
So why did you dial it again?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
You're making popcorn?
Really? What?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
No.
To talk.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Or else what?
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
Answer the question and I will.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
He's not a suspect, is he?
I like it. It's... sexy.
Hold up a sec...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
How is she?
She's tough.
What about the cellular phone bill?
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Call the police.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
I can cry on cue.
No, Sid.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Do they know who did it?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
I don't know, they just did.
Give it to me.
How's that?
Thank you.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
There was a second.
I heard.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Yeah, that's true.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I realize that.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Can we talk about this in private?
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Bullshit.
The fingerprints.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Call an ambulance.
Sorry about that... I just...
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How is this legal?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
What happened?
It was him.
We need a warrant.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
I will.
Are you absolutely certain?
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
How many, would you say?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Well I ain't one of 'em!
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
We got two around that age...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
But what is the truth?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Oh
Yes.
Wait!  Will you desist!
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
See you in jail.
Most interesting.
No, no. You have a wife, children
Yes, I saw it.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Good title.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Who wrote that?
Romeo.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
Wonderful, wonderful.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
"Is the day so young?"
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Like Valentine and Silvia?
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
I have lost my gift.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow…"
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
Will Shakespeare!
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh--no, no!
I must. I must
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Orsino…good name
I have spoken with your father.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
It is only ours you can know.
She loves me, Thomas!
Does she say so?
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
And her voice? Like lark song?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Why, thank you, David.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
Is this necessary?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
I don't know.
There was a break-in.
We just wanted to speak to you.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
About the mail --
I don't know anything about it.
This is just an informal discussion.
No. Why should it?
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes, I suppose so.
Parked outside?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's all?
And you like it?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
She hated you --
The man we know and love.
You see, they don't really know me.
His car's still there.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Don't look?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
What?
What's he doing here?
You were magnificent.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
Oh, shut up, Alex.
That's what I thought he said.
Burglary?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
That wasn't a question.
Do you smoke?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Two hundred pounds.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
That's what I thought.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
No. But he needs treatment.
The first one was fine.
Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
I mean, that's what it's like.
Don't you like her?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
What are you talking about?
What?
I'll be right back, baby, really.
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
What about?
Yes.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
... what?...
That headboard.
Like what?
No.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
What?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Well, yeah... you know.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
You promised you'd do the show.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
He's a very private person, actually.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Did you?
I won't screw you up.
Jackie, can we --
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
Me?
Why?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
What?
I don't know if you don't know --
-- yes, George.
I have to see you.
Here in the canyon.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Now, George --
Yeah.
We live together now.
-- Sure.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Great... can we talk later?
When can I talk to you?
About what?
Whether or not I'm going.
Going where?
When is that?
I'll call you.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
I do, Jill.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
George, now cut this out.
George...
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Well, I don't know.
What about her?
And?
No kidding? Your own shop?
What's that?
Does she know about us?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
What?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Honey?
Well, there was this one time --
That's right.
But why Egypt?
Sort of.
-- never mind.
Do you have something against traveling?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Good.
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
What about Room 237?
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Where does he go?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Who?
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
I did?
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
What time is it?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
Jack...
Get down.
Well...
Hi.
How do you do?
Fine.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Stop it!
What's that?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
There! You see!
I saw what I saw.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
Sure.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
That man -- who is he?
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Hopeless I
I... I brought you something.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
You watch yourself!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
It's true!
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Check your driver's license.
Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
The vow of obedience.
My what?
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
It never solves anything.
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
No.  No.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
You have a phone call.
I must go where I can be of use.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
Get a stenographer.
Okay -- no limo.
Pray. 
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Like what?
You son-of-a-bitch!
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
Where's who?
It's a bluff, Vince.
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
It's better than ice cream.
A Benedictine.
Christy.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Find 'em!
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
How did you hear this?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
You need to sleep.
What?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Up.
The Western Woods.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
Baltus Van Tassel.
What books?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
Take the reins.
He has proposed to me twice.
Are you so superstitious?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What are you on about?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
I... I can't do this.
Yes, actually.
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
Turn around.  Now!
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Okay. You don't have to though.
Karl's my name.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Leave.
I know Albert. We're friends.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
What are all them books?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How do you know?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
He ain't no count.
I don't reckon I know.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Me, too.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Naw.
Yes sir.
I'll be.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Karl is a guy guy?
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Yeah.
Why won't he talk to women?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Actually, I'm his father.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Huh?
What's that, Sol?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
She probably died.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Yeah, like what?
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Bully for you.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Lovely.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
And why the hell would you give me money?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Those are pretty hostile words.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
What's your offer?
Baby? And what baby is that?
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
So what's the time?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Thanks. 
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Well?
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
And the next one...?
Pretty darn clear.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
And why.  Is that?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
He didn't want to lose any more.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
You're right.  I better use two.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
I was checking the cables.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
I should show them an American?
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I don't think so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
That's all he said.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Get lost, will you?
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
A what?
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Hey, she's ticklish!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
We're not?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
You better come help me.
You tore it again!
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
What happened?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'm Sugar Cane.
That's ridiculous.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
What's the surprise?
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
We could -
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Personally, I'm Type O.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Bull fiddle.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Who?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Pleased to meet you.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
I don't care.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
My car?  Why, you -
It's not the backs that worry me.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
You don't say?
About what?
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
What makes you so sure?
I don't think so.
Not very likely.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
You're society girls?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
If it's at all possible -
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
They shrink when they're marinated.
You poor, poor boy.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
All right - if you insist.
From a rich millionaire.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You're not?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Booze.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Okay, Charlie.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
Are you sure you’re okay?
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
Mom, please.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Crikey.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Not for a dog.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
You’re too good for him.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
I have a friend at the magazine.
Oh, no.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
Okay.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
What?
Oh, cut the crap!
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Meet Nick.
Just drunk enough.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
No buts, Rita!
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Where was you, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
That's right!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
David, come back here!
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes, ma'm...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
Whatcha got there?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Maybe soon--
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
But, Nathan--
I wanta see Nathan.
I am the clitoris.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
Okay.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
What?
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Hey, Chef.
What?
MPH RM!!!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Kay.
It isn't fair!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
Wow!
Yeah, so what do we say?
I thought you had something planned.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
No, it was worse than that...
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Oh yeah!
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
You did? Just now?
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Cool!
He's shutting off the air!!!
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Well I appreciate that.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
Thank you.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
That's clear.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
Why?  Where are you going?
Taylor!  Where are you?
Marry you?
Try not to think about it.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
He's in the bathroom.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How am I supposed to know?
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
The pin machine?
Nope.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Think he bought it?
I'm not on the tour this year.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
Who gave it to you?
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
I ain't nobody's father!
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
Putt-putt golf?
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I'm getting to like it here.
Clam it!
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello, mom?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
How's that?
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
No!
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
What ever happened to just bowling?
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
How Mr. Kastle?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Where can I find him?
Coming right up.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
What does he do?
I'd rather you didn't.
No, I'm fascinated.
I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
He said he'd sponsor me.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Nothing.
What's plan C?
Plan C...  ...is me.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
You got any broken bones?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You're really pissing me off.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Can you change something this big?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
I can't...
How long will that be?
But you've tested it?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Captain.
Then why am I here?
What do you need me for?
It's impossible.
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
What team?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
What's the message?
Sir, about leaving --
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
What?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
It never occurred to me.
Good theory, Ted.
The library.
My gosh, Norman.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Yeah, why?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Don't do this.
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Don't bother me, Norman.
I fixed your suit.
He what?
That wasn't in there before.
Something for burns.
Ulcers.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Parasolutrine?
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's a soporific.
Causes sleep.
Your watch.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
It's either this... or I kill you.
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Beth --
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Yes you are...
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
You holding up alright?
Wait a second, I --
Not a clue.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Gimme another explanation.
What noise?
It's like...
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
That's right.
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Her legs are in the way.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Think about it.
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
"We are friends".
They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
Like what?
You mean a picture?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
This is like nursery school.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Not any more!
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
What do I do?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Send one squad up.
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
Move out of the way!
He'll be well cared for.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Well, maybe you better look again.
It's what I deserve.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Your father will never let you.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Hey, check it.
Zander, please... Let's go !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
So ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
I thought you were going to help Carl.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
I'll meet you outside.
I can't help it.
You're right. Let's never stop...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
Did you get Starside R&D ?
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Yes, ma'am !
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
You're the best.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
What's that, Diz ?
I'm on it !
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
No, sir.
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Been better, buddy.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
To join with him.
The information will not be disclosed.
Yes.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thrusters at station keeping...
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
To you, sir?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
We're ready, sir.
Well, it had sentimental value.
It's in your play.
Yes.
Why?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
No, no, I see...
I understand...
Goodbye.
That whole...
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
No, I don't...
I don't drink.
Oh.
I used to go out with a politician.
I can't get it to come out right.
Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Now you're talking...
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I'm going to tell the truth.
That's right...
Ten thousand dollars.
I beg your pardon?
We had a date.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
They think it's your First Wife...
Nothing happened.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
You got to get out of here...
Tell it with...
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
Scene <u>twelve</u>...arrival at the mill.
The Mayor's outside.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
But we...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
Is...Is the Movie!
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Yes.
And you know what...?
An artist of your caliber...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
That isn't very nice.
Why?
I can't find the writer.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Um, no.
I don't drink.
Why?
I'm gonna nail it.
I'm out.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
For what cause?
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
I didn't say anything to them.
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
<u>Pay</u> her.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
There's no witnesses...
Sherry, this...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I want them thrown in jail.
George, that is so kind of you.
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Well.  It's for you.
Like a big sister.
This is a joke, right?
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm not.
Yes.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
This is my daddy's house --
But Rache...
Ice cold water.
Alright starve.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Yes...if you like big hair...
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
Thursday's fine...
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Where Ben?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
You think I didn't get that?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
And I'm supposed to care.
Just not to me.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
A lot smaller.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What did you do?
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
She was angry at herself.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Don't flatter yourself.
How the hell would you know?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
And you said...
It's the same choice you made.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Give 'em my number.
Worked.  Like a charm.
That's not wh...
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Neutral ground.  What's up?
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
I think so too...
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Like what?
Great to be here.
It was God's will.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Nothing, I guess…
We're not ready!
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Ready for tomorrow?
Huh?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
That's good.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
...gger.
...gger.
Again!!
OK.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Yeah. But not any more.
Great. How old are they?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What's that supposed to mean?
There's the fence...
Well Cooper...
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Good.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We can't--it's power driven!
Moffo!
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
I know nothing of the sort!
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
No, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
What kind of trouble?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
You're damned right they are.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I don't think so, sir.
That's close enough, Major.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
What's your point, Lothar?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Then get off my back!
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Sure, King.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Knock yourself out.
Yeah.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah, I guess.
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
You didn't get me in trouble.
No I quit.
Yup.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Sounds like a bummer.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
The dude wants it.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
I'd get bored.
A long, long, long...
Okay.
So you can do an album cover?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Good.
No, I mean, no one.
Hey, you know me.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
What?
She's dead?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Jeff! Let's go!
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Please!
Are you talking to me?
Oh, you were there?
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Please.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Yeah.
Yeah!
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Maybe upper-middle-class.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
I'd love to read that.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Mm-mm.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Good. That's good.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Nazeer what?
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Oh, yeah?
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
I don't know.
You do.
No, I don't.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Where are you going?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Good, man.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
It's stupid.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
So? What's L.A. like?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Where do you get your ideas?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
So where are you?
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
Oh, Jack...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
We were told you could "fix us up."
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Kansas?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Action! The scene starts.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I didn't.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Phillip, you're mad!
I tell you this is half sold.
What about all those ideas you had?
Check.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Twenty-two.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
We've missed you too, dear.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Why?
Uh-huh.
I wrote that with my heart.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
You'll like it here.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Okay.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Just follow me.
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Thank you, darling.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Uh-huh?
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
And she's turned you into a servant.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Paramount is calling.
But where?
The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Have fun.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
It's for your own protection.
You don't like me? You hate me?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Just like that?
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
And you think you're in love.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
The scoop of the year!
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I allowed it to escape the City.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'm Linda Lee.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I have to talk to you.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Not yet.
What? Palace? Hardly.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Oh...I came close once.
No, thanks.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Me neither...
Anyday...
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Kitchen. . . Technician
A television set?
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
What about this week's check?
Say what?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
I don't think you understand.
Decaffeinated too?
Which country?
That what they call you?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
What will it do?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Watch out for them air pockets!
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
We've already met.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
Tell me.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Missing????
Don't cry, Bubba.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Everything on it.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Does she know about it? She's in it!
Why didn't you go before we left?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Constantly.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
But he's never there.
But why the hair?
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What?
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Albert!
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Actually, she's silver-haired.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Super...man. Hmmm...
Screaming
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Oh.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Bingo!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
We just take it?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
Ready.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Gets you where you live, huh?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He'll be weightless.
And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
You think they're strange?
How much do you weigh?
Pink.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Maybe I should get help.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
They'll soon be over.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
Which clinic?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
What happened?
I understand.
Why are you telling me this?
It just seems...kind of weird.
And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
Goodnight, Nicole.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
I have to.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
And what's that?
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Anything you didn't understand?
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
Oh.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Poached salmon.
Yes.
Who did they get for that?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
In what way?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Why were you scared?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Nothing.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
Will the police do anything to her?
We're on our way there now...
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Hurry back.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Is it news to you?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
Susan!...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Can I come in for a minute?
Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
I read your column every day...
Can't hurt...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
In his apartment -
Hello.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
We stick in each others craw.
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No one must follow your work.
My mission is to protect you.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
You will.
Pain causes it?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
No.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Trust me.
What?
Gimme that Phillips right there.
No!  Don't kill him!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
I don't know.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
You bet.
Your manner.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
It's the truth.
Sure.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Yes, von der Null.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Never heard of him, who is he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
The Miracle Kid.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Come to the office, please.
Don't wear the beige one.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
What?
You volunteered?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Good fighters.
Ticklish?
You're not supposed to.
Cover...our footsteps...
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I can't sleep.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
Like shit, boss.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Where are you going?
How do you know that's the way?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Wha... ?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Yes.
Always.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
How do you know?
What?  Connie...
Yeah.
There's nothing to forgive.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
No, thank you.
Oh... it's a game.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Hm?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
I know who she is.  Take a message.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Don't ask.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You warm my heart.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
No.
Yeah.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Well... we're glad to have you.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
It was a stupid thing to do.
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
How could you do this to people?
But the experiment was a failure.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know, you know...
Then let's go get you one.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
Why?
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
We'll find him.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
It was better than a telegram.
Terry Valentine.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
Not much -- you?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Now who's being sarcastic?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Where you get your bank statements.
I can see the attraction.
He alive to see this?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
What's in Big Sur?
Poor baby.
It was you.  Downtown.
Eh?
Of the deal, man.
And that is?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He had urgent business in the north.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Which kind?
What's in it?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
We've certainly missed you.
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
And how do we share--
Yeah.
All right.
She's a rare one.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
What happened to you?
Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
It was Big Dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Oh, hell. Drink?
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Uh-huh.
How d'ya like them apples?
Uh-huh.
This hair.
Uh-huh.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
Not an owner.
I'm in.
I'll go down and speak to him.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Yes.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
Correct.
The sub-basement?
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
He's right.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Another storage room.
It's reptilian.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I think... it means it's full.
It's coming.  Run.
You have to.  Do it now!
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
Sweep the harbor.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
The memory of who?
I think I've studied enough.
Nursery?
What exactly?
Gee, that's great.
Every time you and Marlon--
What?!
You blaming me for the traffic?
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
I'll try.
You got it.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
I don't understand.
They took her --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes.
No, they don't.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Show you right on a map.
Old friend of your father's.
He just let it explode.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
Negotiating with whom?
I'm not sure. A virus --
No. I haven't.
Something sweet.
Get dressed, Scully.
There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
This virus -- it... 
For the purpose of what?
Come on!
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
I don't know.
He's come and gone.
A virus?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Okay, okay...
Yes mother.
Why did we stop?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Mocky-Lock.
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
I think that's the whole point.
Yes.
What about the cat?
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Need we go through it all again?
Well you read this.
Tell me more.
We're both in it, Harry.
It's all right.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Me.
Why?
Have you seen Calloway?
He told you, didn't he?
I'm sorry.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
And my passport?
It wasn't important.
That's what we want to find out.
How will I know you?
No, not yet.
September '39.
I can't. He disappeared...
This is where he vanished.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
You can get somebody else...
Sure...
What do you want?
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
His name?
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
There is one problem.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
Yes.
A bit fucking late.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
But he has been there, off course.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Uh-huh.
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
People still need values, beliefs....
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Why not?
It looks a little like a swastika.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
I didn't realize you cared.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Notice? Like what...?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Those aren't Jews.
So you're saying it's not true.
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
It's German.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
Steve...
Steve's going to explain it.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
What kids?...
You can heat them up and eat with him.
<i>New York Times</i>...?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
The mother.
Here...
Who even knew?
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
I can tell....
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Funny?
They're not that Jewish.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
What d'you mean?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Hello!
No.
Okay.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
You know what I'm talking about.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Why?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
... What's your name again?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Everything about what?
Yes.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
You jumped in?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Why?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
You are the father.
No.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Johana... New York.
In my apartment?
... Sally?
Again?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Yes... It's magic.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
But... how is he going to breathe?
He isn't going to breathe.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
I said, do you come here often!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
We go to the same temple.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
He's still working out some identity issues.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
It's Friday.
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Good looking?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
What do you want to see him for?
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
It's better you don't know.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I'm sure of it!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Get it out of here!
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Now look what you've done.
Don't be soft.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
That doesn't make sense.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
I got into a little crap game.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
When will they be back?
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that easy?
Disney! How inter...
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
You splendid bastard...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Get to the point, will you...
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Can you tell me how you spell...
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Hah... What about Nathalie?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
May I have your phone number?
...On holiday?
Where?
Where are the kids?
What kids?
What company?
What’s the Ambassador?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
I’ll call again.
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Thank you, Jane.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Anything at all?
Does it matter?
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - you’re the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
What about his girlfriend?
Could that be Camden Market?
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
It’s a good guess...
Do you think I could have some water?
Now?
I thought you were an archer?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
One day you will.
Sound the retreat...
I tried to.
I leave the answer to God.
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
We want her burned as a witch!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Where... where am I?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
I'll be right here... I promise.
The English??
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
You have nothing to regret...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
You did well...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
Is it long and hanging down?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Not for long...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
How many did he give you?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Because... I have to be alone!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Oh no?  How about this one?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I need to confess again.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Who is this "he"?
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Who are you?
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
Thanks.
I've no money.
Yes, please.
That's better than yesterday.
That's also my business.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Toilets?
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
I am... I was a pianist.
In the attic.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Baines is packing up?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I miss you.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
What are they?
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
On your piano, that is the swap.
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
He'll probably fall down.
Billie.  You ready?
You got a bag or somethin?
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Don't worry about it, pal.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Lonnegan.
See ya and raise three.
Five and call.
The name is Lonnegan.
What are the odds on Syphon?
You're more gutless than I thought.
Who are you?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
It isn't any better.
2:00 A.M.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
So could Shaw.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Don't think I know him.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
Just a minute...
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Go!
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Go away!
Nothing.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
You hand that over to the police.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Which way did she fall?
What would your mother say to that?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
And he still wants to marry me!
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
know.  But I saw him -
What'd he think it was to you?
Keep on asking.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Extraordinarily lucky.
--was Wynant's.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
No.
Tell 'em.
Let him have his say out.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Chris!
Just what I said I'd do.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Oh, he's sitting up.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
What'll I do if something comes up?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
All right - you didn't.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Hello, baby.
Oh, this is Andy --
What are you going to do with it?
Yes.
Can't you get to sleep?
They were kidding you.
Yeah.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I don't know.
But Wynant --- ?
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
No.  Nobody but you.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
I hope you're well.
Police!
Yes.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Who fired you?
What's in the other direction?
We can't just go off and--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Move!
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
I've got no stomach for murder.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Another month in this desert and I might just.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
I heard it.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Stay low.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Is it dead?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way.
Wes is dead!
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Sure.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Just let me rest for a second.
And then what?
Shi'ites, I think.
But...
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Naw, nothing.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
If!  If there's a treasure.
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Yeah, we're down.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Violation?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
You've seen enough.
Now?
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
They're watching us now.
What?
What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
No?
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Thanks.
Just do it.
Hang on.
Now wait just a fucking-
Don't push it, slick.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
Where you guys at?
Okay, let's go in.
Make up your mind, trigger.
What... ?
Who is he?
Taylor's dead.
Stay in the truck.
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Look who's talking, old man.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Quiet!
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Report on the case so far.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Yes.
In a moment.
About tonsils.
No.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Constantinople?
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Monescu.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
No--proud. Very proud!
Thank you.
What time is it?
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
The fourteenth of May.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
M'sieu Laval!
What's wrong now?
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Good night. 
You would?
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
On the night table.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Adolph J. Giron.
Goodbye.
Divine ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
The ship will sink.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Don't drop it Rose.
Rush her.
Don't you mean work me?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
An accident?!
Not the better half.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Excuse me.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Jack.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
You're right. Only you can do that.
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
How'd you ever get away with it?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Isn't that interesting?
No-o!
Get moving--
Sure!  Excuse me.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
How about giving me another coat?
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Married?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Don't rub it in.
At seven-thirty?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Lonesome?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
You can live that down, can't you?
Jimmy!
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Partners, ain't we?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Good night!
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
What's that?
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Knots!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you happy?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Well, he has a straw hat--
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
--you'd go with him!
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Good night!
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Thank you.
Telegrams.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
That's not what I meant.
Not now.  I don't have time.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
But wait, you don't understand-
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Ignore her?
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Where do you get these questions?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Wait!
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
Not anymore, not after this.
We'll see about that.
What're you talkin' about?
That didn't sound like thunder.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Admiral, are you suggesting -
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Sir Elliot.
- Instant melt-down.
What about the gold?
Where can I find him?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Do you?
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Fishing?
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
That's reassuring.
Hey - the world is my office.
Who knows? Fog, night...
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Interesting video tape.
I didn't think so.
Thanks.  Take care -
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Trust me.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
... Yes?
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
I understand.
What do you make of all this?
It doesn't quite add up.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
I see you two have met.
My timing always was lousy.
You disappoint me, Number Three.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Junior spends time with his child.
I ought to break your damn neck.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Do you think you won?
He will be alright.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Tolerable well.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
It is so considerate of you.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
What?  What is it?
HO-YAAAHH!!!
All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Will you quit moving around?!
Alright!  That's it!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Okay, save your batteries!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Okay, thank you.  At ease.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
That's right.  Your toys.
Bad news?!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Ah, come on now!
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
It was only a mouthful!
All the time.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Well, I hope it stays that way.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Honey, your father knows the President.
I don't know.
Cincinnati Country Day.
I get A's.  All A's.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Nope.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
No --
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
We keep our mouths shut.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
An informant.
He'll do what I say.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
Oh, man --
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
I'm sorry.
You were in my way.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
What? Steady like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What happened?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Fuck, OK.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Now remember --
Nightmare.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Did he -- you know?
He made me lick it.
Fuck you.
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
But you don't have the money?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
The Sick Boy method.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
That's hardly a substitute.
Why, thank you.
In that case --
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Rescued at last.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Bob?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
No, but you can bet they will.
The power was within you.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Because it's there.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Not possible. You were never alone.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I don't control minds. I free them.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Your vision?
Am I? We'll see.


No. You must kill me.
I cannot go with you.
I belong here.
Sybok, we must find a way...
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
You call that getting over it?
I mean I want both of us to go.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Flynn?
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Well, isn't it -- ?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Wrote the...?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Alan-One...
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
That's all going to change, Yori...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Yeah, Dad.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Son of a bitch!
Yeah, but for who?							*
You're welcome.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
No!  Never!
Yes sir.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Okay.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
What?
Dance?
So what's your angle?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
I understand.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
His wife.
Nope.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Ya looked through it?
Want some Goobers?
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Tell me about yourself.
Yes, I would.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
At the movies?
So he really loved her?
What?
You will?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
What?
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Cancoon.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Two guys.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Let me handle this.
Yeah?
In case of what?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I can see what you mean.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
On their honeymoon.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Could we try it now?
Do you believe him?
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
He saw the wire.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Read my lips.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
You're still a little... disoriented.
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
You're afraid of germs?
1995?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
What?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
It was?  I didn't...know.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Then how come she knows what's going on?
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
You afraid of the dark?
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Where in Mexico would you like--
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
Sheriff Potter.
Wrong number.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
That's right on my way.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
May I carry your package, Grace?
You sure you can manage?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
That's all right.  I got it.
Yes, I have.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Like they're made of polyester.
Whatever it takes.
From?
Lied?  What do you mean?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Stop it.
What was I supposed to do?
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
You could give me the gun.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Can you climb back up.
I'm here.
I'm her husband.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Like you don't know.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I had a problem getting my car back.
Isn't that illegal?
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How do you put a price on murder?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Do we shake hands?
You love her, but you hate her?
Shut up.
You think that's a lot of money?
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
What are you babbling about?
I said come on!
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
They're not very imaginative?
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Who's cursed?
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
It ain't broke.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Like you don't know.
I did?
It's not what you think, Jake.
You came to take my wife from me?
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars?
What?
How about I pick one out for you?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
But you was going to fight for me.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How much time?
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I'm just going to my car?
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You're not from around here, are you?
I just drove in this morning.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
Still playing?
No.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
You don't have any money put away, do you?
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Stop it.
No! You get it!
Anywhere?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
That's a nasty cut you got there.
"Arkady"
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I don't care, just get me there.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
What did I say?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh shit...
Jesus.
What about the game?
I don't know Megan.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
What's he look like?
I'll help you.
How much can you lift?
Okay.
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Building his porch!
You ain't dead.
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Oh. Yeah.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Shit and fried eggs.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
What's all that wood?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
He's... he's dead.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Yeah, I guess so.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Huh?
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Well... I don't recollect.
Shut up, Kid.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
We all got it comin', Kid.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Beats the hell out of me.
HEY, KID.
How far kin you see?
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
No... I meant...
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Yeah?
What was the money for?
Who ?
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Three million?
This I had to see myself.
Who's your boss?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
I shivved him.
Business or personal?
What'the fuck is that?
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
You know damn well what I think.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
But Keaton...
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
I'm fine.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
Yes.
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
) I'm sorry ...?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
You know what happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Who are you protecting, then?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
What?
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Overruled...
I can't guarantee that...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
How come you're calling me from...?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Maybe what?
What...?
That's what I am.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Uh ...
...I'm going to need your help...
I'm going to help her.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I'm going to get laid.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
Read me what she said.
The 'History'...?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
... You saw her?
You live in the neighborhood?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes.
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
As I've said we had some more...
What happened in those three...
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Almost a year.
Then?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
I want you.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
She... went into the Bay.
You're not far wrong.
Dinner... and what else?
Tomorrow night? Well --
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Yes --
Honest?
But Scottie, you don't have to!
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Some money.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
When?
This afternoon.
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Wandering about.
Oh! Yes! Here!
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Why?
Knowing I have to die...
No.
I know.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
You can't.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
What is her name?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
It wasn't your fault.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
That!?!
Okay.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Did you need it?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Well that's what I said.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Multiple reasons.
Playing?
Don't point at me.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
What are you doing?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
There's more.
Sure, why not.
What about the blood?
We can't do this.
I am not flexible on this.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
I won't do it.
What.
There's more.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
The groom?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Give me two more.
Call 911.
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
He is not cracking up.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Then what do they have?
You said nobody would miss her.
No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
Give me the Valium.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
Time out.
I've seen it on television.
Kiss me...?
I'm not. What's the problem?
Just a bit of organizing.
I'm mad at you.
Where are you?
Well, can you come back inside?
Can we just talk this out?
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
The prostitute.
You fucked a prostitute?
Like how?
Move the bodies.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Just kills me...
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
What?
Did he try to kiss you?
All week long.
...embarrassing, shameful...
Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Drum banging real times.
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
Then it's a respectable house.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
What about them?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Whatever you like.
Wasn't that cowardice?
What's the matter?
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
That's it.
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Canelo!
They told me it isn't at the hospital.
There's been an accident.
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
Good, then let's go!
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
No, I don't want to.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
What about them?
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
I'M WHAT?!
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
Should I have?
It was you, wasn't it?
That's not true, Parker.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
What you need is a collar.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
No, this is great.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't hold.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?
In the yellow ribbon.
We'll be back tonight.
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
...fourteen years...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
How's your wife?
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...

CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
...you the Press Office?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
...going to War...
...that's what it is.
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's ïretirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Is he dead?
Uh huh...why?
Why not?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
Keep Talking....
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
Better.
You like it?
Why a beret?
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
What about tipping off Yurovich?
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Hey the door was open.
Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Coulda been a contender.
About what?
I met them before you were born.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
...I can't even see it...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
What makes you think you can?
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
I don't.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
I'll let you know.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Old values. Buy.
It's over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
I can't...and I won't.
Businessman!
Yeah 
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Hi
Hmm.
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Jenkins!
Tony and China?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Oh that explains everything.
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
No, he wouldn't.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Do you have any idea who she is?
What do you think I should do?
Your friend saw them.
She isn't here.
You're the flower lady.
I've never even met you.
And then you weren't there.
Thank you.
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Do we have to?
Well good.  So you're human.
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
You got it.
Please.  That's all I need.
I don't know.
Shhh.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Hartford?
But Claire--
Jody he was lying.
Fine.
Shhh.
Mmm.
After that.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Really?
Oh, no...
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Tonight?
...like it never even happened...
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
What's the matter?
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
I never asked you to quit!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
Claire...
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
But why would they do that...?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
I don't want it.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
There are things I have to know!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
FAST.
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
Lie...?
There are things you will not tell him.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
My jury's still out on that,
And whose houses do you design...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What's wrong..?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
That's not funny.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
You bastard!
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
All the time?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Out - I may be some time
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
At 2.00...
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
That's crazy talk.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Check it out!
Take a whiff of heaven.
Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
These are real, live women?
We reinvented ourselves.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
From your lips, to God's ears.
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
We miss you. We miss our son.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
It's okay. You need me?
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Everything.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
I'm trying to help.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Really? You wanna write about me?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I guess.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Eventually you'll let go.
But you never do.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
That's refreshingly deviant.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You're quick. I like that.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
He was in a league of his own.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
People pay good money for that?
I'm just a messenger.
And the child...
You mean he withdrew...
I'd like that.
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Suzie?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Just tell us what happened.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
A ride.  You want one?
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
What brain?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I miss Dad.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Yes.
Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
No little girl can ever make me come.
You can't...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
You, Kelly, Sam.
That's right.  That was his name.
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
That was the same thing Ray said.
We?
No.
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Try what?
Is this leading somewhere?
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
I'm going to hit you.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Relax.  We're almost there.
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
What?  President Grant is...!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Of course not.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Really?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Private train?
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Nicely said, sir.
And?
Philistine.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Let's go.
Me?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You hear trouble.
I will.
I thought you had her!
I did?
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
You?
The art of transformation!
I changed her already!
Here.  Hold her.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Why not?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
They're Amish.
John, I don't understand any of this.
John, why?...
Pretty much.
Who'd you see?
Okay, Mr. Book.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Just us.
No.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Can I have something to drink?
Only the elders.
How long have I been here?
Anything against zippers?
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
No. I'd want a public phone.
I know what he said.
Where's my baggy pants?
I hear you.
Yes, thank you very much.
I have to help him!
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
All right, where is he?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
No --
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Not so fast!  Not....
You are?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
I have?
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Oh --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Oil can....
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
But why?  Why?
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Um-hmm.
Oh --
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Ah --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Somebody pulled my tail.
I -- Oh --
Here --   Come on.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Yeah.
Quiet!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Dorothy!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
You promised us real things -- a real...
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
...you should rest.
I have to go.
No. You’ll be safe here.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Just like you...only you were even easier.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
I’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
Laurie --
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Where did he go?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Please.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Looks like a diner.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What weapons do you have?
You do everything Yorgi says?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Here we go again.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Beast.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
For what purpose?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Uh-huh.
If necessary.
What if they're naughty?
Senator?
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
How?
Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
Enough for a test.
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
What?
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Yes.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Oh, nice.
Surprised!
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
Is it worth taking a chance?
It seems fine.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Break that old man's violin.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
I see.
What?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
How?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Yes, Master!
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Well...
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
What do you think we should do?
Stop -- singing!!!
Not fooling around.
MMmmm.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
