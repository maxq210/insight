Forget it.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
You might wanna think about it
I did.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
You did what?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
So they tell me...
Get out!
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Sure
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She kissed me.
What?
A deal's a deal.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We don't chat.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
William would never have gone to a state school.
Who cares?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Seven-thirty?
That's what you want, isn't it?
Why, don't you?
I'm fine. I'm
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Were you in jail?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Go to the prom with me
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
So what I want doesn't matter?
Right.
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
I'm likin' you guys better
Thank God...
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
I knew you would.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
We can't be.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You bloody...
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Somewhere else?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Nah, I musta missed it.
Who says she's a suspect?
Better than one.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Yeah.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
How many victims are up there?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright?
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
That's unique.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Where's Czech girl?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
We have no money.  Come on.
Cut!
Did you hurt her?
We started over, you can too.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Alright.  Go ahead.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
How long they been livin' here?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Okay. 
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Well, how's it going back there?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Fortunately, they did.
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You're done.  End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Sure, anything you want.
No way to start a partnership.
I may call you worse than that.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Come on.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Shit.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah, I read the report...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
When? How?
I still don't think it's loaded.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Where is he?
How would you know?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Five bills.
Give it back.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
No thank you.
I know...
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Hey bud! Finger here.
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
We will be ready, Lord.
Hi Ma...
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Have you pulled yourself together?
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
I've had enough good news for today
I thought you were divorced.
Learning language.
All 900.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
...What do you mean?
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
You couldn't?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Don't...
Amy...
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
I promised him to Machine.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
We can do that.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Sure.
Fuck off.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Why?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What did you do with her body?
Show me where you buried her.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
They're no friends of mine.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut up.
I'll risk it.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Alright, I get the picture.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
Why do you think he did it?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
What?
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
I'll do what I can.
I can't find him.
I'm sure they're around.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
I know.
What?
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Earth to Alice...
About Freddy?
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
You had a nasty bump.
It's okay, Dan
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
Who said I...wait, what?
I've got to go.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I don't know!
My undying love.  Have some.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
I want to talk about the baby.
My father!  He's not - ?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
I think you're right.
Seems to be all around...
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
That's what I said!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You think so.
Double A. New Britain.
Yeah.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Shit.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
He sure as hell won't.
Yeah.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Nothing.
You can't.
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I know who it is.
For a while.
How's she doing?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
What way?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Good.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
There's a furnace.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
His office. You mean my old office.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
You no-good pup!
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
How was she?
Who?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We're not going to make it.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
You'll do it?
One thing I've learned as
Hold on, Alice.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
But...
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Sir?
Who's that, Ted?
What word would you use, Elaine?
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Yes.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Then Elaine was right.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
He had fish, too.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Would you go up, please?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Yes...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
This is mole.  It's good.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Thank you.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Sure.  Just a minute.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Don't tell me what to think.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
What?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Dead on all channels.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Sir?
What's the question?
Sure, Hicks.
Let's get these things lit.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
We ain't going anywhere.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
No.. I've slept enough.
They're dead.
Why do they tell little kids that?
You mean dead.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Where?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
What?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
You have leave to try.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Why?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Yes!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Stanzi!
Yes, my love?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Why not?
Originals?
What?
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Money! Money!
When, may I ask?
Adorable!
Gertrude!
Yes?
Twenty-six.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Ah, love again.
Is she not here?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Pupils?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Do any pupils come to the house?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
So there you are. What do you say?
Put it down!
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Really?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
I'm afraid not.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
You mean she's not coming back?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
The man. He's here.
Strange!
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
You go fast!
Yes.
What for?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
On the contrary.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
And do they believe it?
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Did we?
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
The American? Yes, duck.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Yes, I believe he did.
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
David?
Sorry.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
But, David.
Okay.
I'm freezing.
I should be committed.
Pull over.
No what?
I thought not.
Has he been refusing food?
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
You ask them.
I heard that.
Yeah.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Will you be quiet?!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
If I was still alive, I probably would.
I want you to meet some people.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
He's on the telephone.
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I'd like some tea, please.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
He has?
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Charlie!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
I remember once when your account checked.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
What do you mean, help?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Why, of course.
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Line?
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Don't you know?
No.
I want to be near you!
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Well . . .
Happy now?
Sure, I think it's swell.
I can't tell you.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Why pick on him ?
What'll we do?
Don't you think I know it?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
All right.
Matt, come here!
Oh, is that so?
All right, dear.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Yes, why?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
He just lost his temper a little.
Exactly.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Tell me.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Perfect, Cole.
Let's ride.
Don't let it happen again.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
What will be?
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you too, cousin.
You ride like a Comanche.
Both would be nice.
The brown one.
Strategically.
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I think he's already feeling better.
I figure.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
You are a charmer.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Don't care.
The posters?
If I could go back to farming --
Jim was old enough...
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Yeah, Jimmy?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Nuh-huh ...
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Sparkling rocks?
Little ones.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Let the law --
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
"Hmm" what?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Stop it. This is just sad.
That's the idea.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
And the same age Web was. No.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Not at all.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
How much did they get from the safe?
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Can't you tell me anything?
On a lot of lithium?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Dorsia's nice.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Are we here?
I never knew you smoked.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Would you like to see my apartment?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
You're inhuman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It looks so soft.
Jesus lives, Luis.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Ask me a question.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
See you then.
After six.
Can you bring Mr...
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Dorsia is...fine.
They know me.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Just...say...no!
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Uh huh?
Who?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
You seem...nervous.
No problem. 
Yale thing?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Where did Paul hang out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
He had a yacht?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Not a big music fan, eh?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Marcus?
But Marcus denied it?
I'm so hungry.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Oh well, you know.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Another Martini, Paul?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
No, Owen.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
You don't wanna move, do you?
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What're you -- what?
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
What?
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Great.
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
My goodness.
Is it your dish?
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Well -- you sent for me.
Oh. Yeah.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
I mean, it's your life.
You know my name.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
They'd frame him.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
Gary.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
That's lame, isn't it?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
What does that mean?
She's a programmer?
Where is he?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Right away, Exposition.
Thank you, Basil.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Yes, Basil?
Good on ya, man.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
That does not compute.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
My meat and two veg.
How do you know?
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Indeed.
Yes.
Oh, behave!
Don't worry!
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Shut up.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
In due time.
What did you say?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Really?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
... bottle ...
You mean you don't recall??
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
To you ... ?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Thank you, Steed.
Then what's stopping you?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Yes indeed. I need protection.
For a man in my position --
Any ideas?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Orders.
It wasn't me; you have my word.
I'm playing to win.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
You didn't tell her?
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
I know all this.
I fail to see --
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Global warming?
How did you guess?
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Amnesia?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Where?
She was ...
I was at Harrow ...
If you say so.
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Hey, man, congratulations!
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I'm marrying Debbie.
What is this person's story here?
Shit!
Yes I did.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
1002.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
But a fabulous cook.
I think your dinner's burning.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
What's the matter?
C'mere.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
You better not have too much joy.
Why don't you get undressed.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You're on.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Great, Mom.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
I didn't know you were into that.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
I'll take some.
Milt?
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
What do you mean, it changes?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
It's Bullwinkle.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
All right, who serves?
I'd love that.
Then it's on to the real thing.
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
I don't know.
Got me.
Debbie.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
No.  I need a drink.
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
In the Field Museum once.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
How do you know?
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
The outlets.
I need another one, sir.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Yeah.
Just wondering.
Yeah.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Management were pin heads.
I was ahead of my time.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
He just wants to --
The great communicator.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
How about 7 1/2?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Yeah!
Please.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What do I do?
You might be right.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Must be the pressure.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We're starving.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm telling you it's not.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Do you know how you will use him?
Sounds risky to me.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
You sound like the media.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
No.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
What do you mean?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Oh her.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...perfect...
The good stuff.
Are you trying to rap to me?
I know I won't be your puppet.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Neither!
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Not even that.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
As much as possible.
All the same, you must name an amount.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
What do we do?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
They're dead, aren't they?
Okay.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Why?
Do I?
But not the only victim, right?
I didn't kill him --
Mr. Hardy?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
That's horseshit and you know it.
The Senator...
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Not for long.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
I lost a bet.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Got it.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
I don't know.
Watch me.
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
What happened next?
Buttfucks the cabin?
Little bit.
You mean the falsely accused?
Good, just making sure.
Right back where we started.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Poor fucker my ass...
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
What the fuck are you doing?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
We're not going anywhere.
Yeah.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Yes!
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
No one's ever left.
Fine, I'm doing it.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Karl.
You learned from the best.
You owe me three-fifty.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
They're your favorite flower.
There is no softer ground than town.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
They met at Auburn.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
So you never bought any land.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
There's over eighty thousand here.
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
It is. I did it cooking.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Right.
And...
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
No, no...
No. It's not that.
John.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
He wants the money from your bank.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
I don't want to know.
I know you just want to punish me --
What? No you're not..
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Oh Jesus.
You don't want to talk about it.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
You are throwing me out.
You don't have to say anything
Please, there's no... Oh.
I wasn't saying anything.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Well what have you got?
Are you scared?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
She's alive?
I'm trying to quit.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
Whatever.
It's a long way to go for a date.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Yeah, I know.
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
I need ya help again.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You been home yet?
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You go to hell.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Rose... please...
LAZ, I said let...!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
In my house, you watch that lip...
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
By myself?
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know that.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Word wit'cha. In private.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Why you say that?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Get me ten bags of mulch.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
That's right.
Rae...
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
It's illegal, Nick.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
I couldn't tell.
Call for help.
Gaiijin?
You could fake it.
He drinks.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Tell them I'm not.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
It is not allowed.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
You certainly have a nice place here.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Would you like to be modified?
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
But not to last.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
No.
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
I was just about to have my dinner.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Go.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.
Not if it works.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Sorry.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Meaning?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
I don't know nothing about it.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
You mean the snake.
I'd never get an abortion.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Oh.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
Like?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
No, I don't.
Sitting next to you.
What desert?
We sure did.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
For how long?
No, you get out of here.
Yes, I'm right?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Right.
Okay.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
I think it's the eyes.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
This is for me.
What?!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Wow.
May I please be excused?
So, what are you seeing?
Good-bye!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Neat. Goodnight!
What?
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
What's baseball?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Uh-huh.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
What?
How old are you?
The sky!!!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I do alright.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
What about relatives?
Really?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Then after that it's safe.
What?
Honey?
Yes.  Well... yes.
Hi.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Mutants?!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Well, I am the head of this household--
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I see "elegant."
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yes, you do!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Okay honey.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You did? A human ear?
The criminals are winning.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
THEN WHAT?
It's okay. It's okay.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
That's good.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Yes.
No, it's not Don.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Here's to Ben.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
What kinda beer do you like?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
This is it.
What?
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's too bad.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah?
Who, me? Why should it?
Shoot.
Yeah.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay. Great!
It's good to see you.
Dorothy Vallens?
No Jeffrey!!
Up where?
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Yes mother.
Got it.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
What happened?
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I-I'll tip her.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
C'mon!
Our mother can see through bags.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Fuck!
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
I don't know they just always need it.
A bit.
Me, too.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
He's a good man.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Where's my cat?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Pee...Per...Man.
Really want to know?
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Twist of lemon!
No way they could have seen it.
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Roc. You okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
What the fuck do you mean?
Y-Yes my son.
Open it!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Bob?
Obviously. That's a given.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
We've got sixteen dollars.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Right now.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Take your second position.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
I'll see you there.
You got to be kidding me.
What do you mean?
It feels good.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
You think I'm improving?
Jesus Christ! No.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You're Anthony?
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
What did I say?
Let's just go.
His name was Swifty?
No. I was calm.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
I don't know.
We'll have to see when we get back.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Bob, you're lying!
I know it, man. Hang on.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
He's stuck between two floors.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Now!
This is no good.
Oh, yeah.
What can we do?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
It was staged?
What?
Because you're afraid!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Sorry. Old habits.
Pamela Landy?
-- take the back -- get another car --
I'll get the book.
But it ends up the same.
Where --
What?
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Where are you going?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
You hear me? I believed you.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Last week? When?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
Are you disappointed?
I'm working on it.
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Alright...
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Scotland. He intends --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
You mock us with a smile?
You fancy him.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
A patriot!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
How do you know this?
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I must... consult with my father.
And I will consult with mine.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Straight up.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
But I... I need those books.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
Duck, here they come.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Of course.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
What?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
We'll find out soon enough.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Evan Treborn.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
No.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
So you decided to go to America.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Come up here a minute.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Er, my check, please.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose we do.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Looking for a job.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Has it got a wow finish?
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
The stairs from the street.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
No.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We'll discuss it later.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Rick? Who's he?
-- Is what?
Won't you join us for a drink?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
My wife?
You love her that much?
But we made a deal.
Very well.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
We'll be there.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I believe you have a message for him?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
What else, my dear Major?
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Perhaps.
Find one.
What, again?
His escape.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
I'm a drunkard.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put it down!
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Good. Then have a drink.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
No water, no work.
Water water water --
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
No.
Must be a story there.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I have to.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Don't even start.
I thought you might have.
You have any children?
And how was your Christmas?
Terrific.  Yours?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Which I didn't have.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Mom, meet Jango.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
I was making a point.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
You weren't dreaming about me.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Good night, Daddy.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Sure. Thanks.
Why?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
But did you know him?
No. She was an immigrant.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Right.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Everything looks in order.
Two million.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
After you cut her loose.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
We're going to give him the money back?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Good boy.
Very much so.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Says who?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Intuition.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
What about the money?
Then shut up.
My place.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
What?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
What was it?
I'll find the time.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Keep it up.
Pretty much.
I can handle it.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
A couple I know are getting married.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
It came my way. 450 a week.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I'm on at nine.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Not talking. Writing.
What?
Found a job?
No.
Near the casino.
The debts.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
That's fine.
You don't like cheats, do you.
Who's they?
The point is, they want a man inside.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
You did?
And what do you do, Lucy?
Have you got transport?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I'm not going to report it.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
We check every four days.
Any exceptions?
Five.
I make it six.
I don't gamble.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
No.
Very impressive.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Energy shielding positive function.
Thanks.
Energy shielding positive function.
Thanks.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
To explode, of course.
Yes, well...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Doolittle...
Which one?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Fred.
-- Remark.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
Yeah?
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
We're running out of time, sir.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Phenomenology...
Guess again.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
Who's Camille?
Could you give us a moment.
You're roommates?
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
I'll make it worth your while.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I don't want to move away.
Mommy, where are you?
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Logan Cale.
Is the social studies class over for today?
I won't be staying.
I'm not a half bad cook.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
A girl.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
I don't know what to say.
Look, thank you for this but--
And you still think you can do something to change that.
None.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
How's this about me?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
I actually know how this works.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
You're the best, Maxie.
We gotta talk.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Does this person have a name?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
And why should she?
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
You don't.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
Okay, okay, okay--
Yeah, a man's drink...
I-I c-can't...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What? That's disgusting!
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Curly.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
What?!
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Our saviour...
Who is... we?
Until it withers away.
We never would have had this conversation.
Will you go with me?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
And what?
Well...
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
But you're OK?
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Who's Frank?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
I think he saved my life.
How so?
How are things going at school?
Can anyone else see him?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
I know.
Yes. I went to jail.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Goodbye, Donald.
Guess who wrote it?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
How did this happen?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Beg pardon?
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Thank God for bunge cords.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
Huh?
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
C'mere. I love you so much.
It's okay.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
My dress'll reek.
That bitch from...
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Gladys! Stop it!
Becky was my only shot at state!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
The king can do to wrong! 
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
His Excellency's car!
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
What other job you got?
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
I can't do it...
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
No... it was a seven letter word.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
No, I think a whiskey.
Like this. 
I'll show you! I'll show you!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
...Yes, Sir.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Oh, yes.
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Mmmerrick."
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Who, Father?
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
It was different...
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Who?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Of course.
I... but I...
Not quite...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
Is it night or day, Erik?
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
Yes?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
Oh, thanks.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
It's always the women that start the trouble.
I've got you!
Who gets killed?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
But...
Well, where is he then?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
Well... I... I thought...
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
No one.
You did? You liked me?
You rat.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Why?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I can't remember.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Very much.
I don't know.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
That's scary sounding.
You should stay.
Yeah.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I think, before.
Oh.
It's dark.
I think we should go.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
That's your look for me.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
You have to stop this!
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
I'm glad you called.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Thanks.
You made me have an abortion.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Yeah. Of course.
Oh dear.
Jesus.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This one's history. Moving on...
Siwash, huh?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
Why? Why do you have to go?
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
Coop, where are you...
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
You're okay now, it's over...
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Does he know that?
What does?
I'm going in.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
There's no one here, Skipper.
Do it.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
If it worked.
The date.
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Better if I just show you.
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Where is it?
That's enough!
What is it, Smith?
I just finished drying...
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
What is it, Starck?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I know that.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
There's no one here.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
How?
The forward airlock.
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Oh, he did.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
'Course not. Strictly business.
Don't you wander off, boy.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Ben! Ben!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
They're not costumes.
Please tell me you go silent too.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
You need a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Your friends use the pool too.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Get a ride with somebody.
What? Are you all right?
All right, I take it back.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
Really.
Chicken!
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Yes.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
How often do you go?
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Hey! That's my line!
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Climax together.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
I want romance.
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
I don't know.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Sure thing.
Excellent.
Not at all.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Naked.
Not down in my parts.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Hell, no!
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I want to leave fast.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Plans?
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
NO! Stop talking like that.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
We're going to get my little girl.
Where's that?
Come on, come on.
Well, justice is funny.
Hey!
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
Follow me.
Shit!
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
My truck.
Your brother, huh?
Anyone else?
Really?
How much I got, what?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Nothing.
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Seven.
Whoa!
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
HELLLLLLLLP!!
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Go!!!
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Deal.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Thank you --
Oh.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
...Yes.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
...I see.
We'll get you home, Frances.
Really?
I didn't have much to do with it.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Good.
See you next weekend?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
What about your husband?
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Yeah, well --
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
What?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You can't drink.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Who're you?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Your big speech?
I already have.
You think I got it?
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Yes, Mama.
I will, I promise.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
What?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
What kindness?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
Yes. Very close
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
A brain. Extremities.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
So do I.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Can you think of a better reason?
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
A... week?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Madness?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Almost five.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Wet. I don't know.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Here we go.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Rocky Road.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I mean...
Sure.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Twenty-eight.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Jacob.
What's this about, money?
On the dresser.
Come again?
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
Auto wreck.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Didn't like it, did ya?
You won't let him touch her?
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Mexico.
Do you believe me?
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Me too.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
You callin' him a liar?
You can't come in here.
He signaled the Ranger.
-- This conversation is over.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
You know what you look like?
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
Sir?  What did he say?
No problem, sir!
West?
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Yes, dear.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
No, ma'am.
Do that.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
I'll try anyway, sir.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Sure, sure.
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
I think you're the liar.
Your new roommate.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
This ain't even workin' wrong!
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Where's Audrey?
We know, Audrey.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
No.
You must have quite some harem.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
That's the problem. He did.
Your old sweetheart?
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What do I get?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Call me Charlie.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
Good idea.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Just don't.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Like YOU know?
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
Shut up.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
Yes you did.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Okay...  Okay, now what.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
GO Commander.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
It helps.
Nothing. Hold please.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Stop, please! I don't know!
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
A model, only as big as this.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
Find them.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Therefore, retreat.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
You invented this, this...
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
I understand, George.
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
These supplies...?
I rode here, on my horse.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa, of course.
Well, we must be who we must be...
Let's get you darker!
Just because they are born?
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
You spotted them, huh?
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Get something going there.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
I'll find it.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
You positive about that?
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Leo, I don't know.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Look at me, Ray.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Sovereign.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
You're an investor, is that it?
Not yet. I just started.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Not really.
What's it called?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Read it. It's a grabber.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
He died.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
I'm looking at you.
Like this?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Here's another tip...
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Don't go out of your way.
What do you think?
There a part in it for you?
Sounds fair.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
I'm going into the movie business.
Hm?
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Really.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
What?
Bring it on, dude.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Seen a lota movies.
A what?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What about running number two by itself?
Three, four days.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Could be meant as a warning.
I think you better see this for yourself.
Not me.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
I bet you did.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
The guy. He just came this way.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
No. I'll try again later.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
Only something must've gone wrong.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
I don't know, are we?
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Epps, over.
Over the gold.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
You got that right.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
And look what happened.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Fine with me.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
What do you mean?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
That's just the way I am!
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
That lets us off the hook.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
You can have that one.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Fuck you!
Oh yeah.
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
Gross!
What are you talking about?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
I know a party we could go to...
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Get away from me!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
So should I come over?
I don't believe you.
Why? What did he say?
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
What time?
It just came yesterday...
Nothing.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I don't think so...
Jesus, Seymour.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
Oh yeah?
Why?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So, do you like me, Seymour?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
What about Joe?
So where would we go?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
No... they said she was here...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Why don't we start with that next week?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
Starling?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
Shhh.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent. 
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Help finish the railroad.
Oh no.
Does he ever mention me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Thank you.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
Does she know anything about babies?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Hi, Egon.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
My pleasure.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Did I forget something?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
I'll get one more reading.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Hi, Louis.
I am Zuul.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
What?
Then leave.
Is he dying or something?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Really!  Is it gone?
Print is dead.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I think it's the food of the future.
That's so romantic.
Thank you.
And may I see this storage facility?
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do you mean by "seen?"
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Where are you, Pete?
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
What?  What popped in there?
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
If I may be so bold...
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Do you want posters, too?
Give away food?
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Was I?
Yes.
I don't know.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Benjamin -- I really do.
At the Zoo.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I don't understand --
Let me go.
The marble?
What?
I just don't think it would...
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
The day after tomorrow?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Thank you.
Yes I am.
No, sir.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Well here's the purse.
Did you get a room?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Of course.
Whatever you say, sir.
Please.
What do you drink?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Well I don't know.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Her portrait?
Come on.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Would you like me to seduce you?
Where is it?
I want to say something first.
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Go ahead then.
I don't.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
How many times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
What?
Well I can't.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
I'm curious.
No.
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Are you?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
You wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Do exactly what I say.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
Sure.
Nothing else.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
You don't?
No.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
I've got to go.
You'll never be young again.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Yes.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Yes?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
No.
How?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Chasing what?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Yes -- oh!
How tired you are!
So alone.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
What can you see?
So --
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
For Vienna?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
You've lost everything?
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
And the child isn't coming?
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
You're trembling.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Movies?
You're a little too fast.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Definitely off.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Here, hold up!
Exactly.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Me?
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Have I kept you waiting?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
We're not really interested, Henry.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
No?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
No.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
A future. The only future I've got.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Scram. Go home.
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Oh, come here.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
Not many.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The cemetery...
Yes.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
My life is a living hell.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
I was trying to protect you from this...
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Then I'll get caught.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
You're right.  It does sound strange.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Thanks!
Very insightful.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
But I've seen him!
You can't expect us to stay here --
Wait a minute ...
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
It's a bitch.
I'm gonna wet my pants.
No.
You know what gets me?
Oh, shit.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home.
You know what gets me?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Me?
You.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
You're making a joke.
You invited me.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're my buddy.
Hello.
Dr. Woodly.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Man and boy.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College!
Excellent!
England?
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Will you go to bed?
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Nothing would please me more.
It's so--so stark.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Such as?...
Tell me about its sexual roots.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Sounds quite beautiful.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
There it is.  Give it to me.
You've killed women?
It's always locked.
He's dead, you know.
We'll miss you so.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Are you've seen it work cures?
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
King Arthur.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Don't!
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
A lot of people don't.
Who have you been talking to?
What?
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Okay.
I'm glad.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Something happens to my confidence.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I see.
Good night.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
She quit this afternoon.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
That's the XKE.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
It's a jungle out there.
It's really that bad?
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
But is she, has...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
No, I don't.
What do you mean?
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Okay.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah.
Something like that. How much do you make?
Up front?
When do we start?
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
At least I'm a growing person.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Neither am I.
Not very.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Fuck.
Where does he live.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
But then you'll forget about me.
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
Mast?
What are you paying me for?
What do you mean?
They are?
The police? They know less than you do.
Do the police want to arrest me?
I just heard. Who is he?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Ratan!
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
To anybody.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Could I see your registration?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Hello.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Because if you are...
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
My door is always open.
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No. 
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Why not?
Is he all right?
Well, I really don't drink...
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With Life.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Yes.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
I have a sore throat.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To whom?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Like a tea ceremony?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
No.
What would you say?
War is not all black.
To pit your own life against another.
The moment of truth.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
But wait...
I knew you'd come.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
What?
WHY?
Because I'm going to get my father!
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
And what about you?
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
I'm lucky that way.
From where??!!
No. It was red. Bright red.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Did he, now?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
No. Don't --
Oh-n-no -- I --
My arm is fine. Where are you??
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Yes?
Good night.
Marco...
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
What's the problem?
You can keep them.
I don't remember.
Poor baby.
I came for the wedding.
Oh my God.
Hell...
So you were cheated.
This afternoon.
O.K. O.K.
Like who?
The best part of ten years.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
I cut myself.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Oh, babe...
Sure.
Drinking alone.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Maybe I will.
Try me.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
I will. See you.
Me like.
I've forgotten.
Really?
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
He's gone.
Gone?
So lie down.
All right.  No. That's nice.
What do we do if there isn't?
If I make it through the day.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
I don't know.
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Play it.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Oh, so what's the point then?
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
What the fuck is that?
None.  Christ!
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Nothing.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
He's not worth it!
What are you talking about?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Great.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
-- Alright, alright but --
And do you like it that way?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I'm not -- hold on...
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You know what I mean.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Yes, of course.
What do you want to do?
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Mission accomplished.
What it was like.
Oh, great...
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
No, but...
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
No.  Probably not.
Well, you've asked.
Is Ray going?
Enough of what?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
The Conformist.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Yeah.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
I knew this was going to happen.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Records are those big round black things, right?
We're not there yet, Justin.
How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Fine.
Carl Smith.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
I've been to Church Hill.
Dupont Circle.
What about me?
Have you gone to the police?
No.
They do it each year.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
The inheritance.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
How can you know this?
Pheasant.
You know me home.  Me name.
No!
No!
You will live.  Survive.
How can I stop such a man?
Go to hell.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
Tradition.
You're wrong.
Finish yours?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We need more time.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
Thanks.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
I don't know.
He knows I'm here.  How?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Leave her out of this.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Get up.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
Home.
All I need is time.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
Hello, Bensinger.
No. Roy. Roy V.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Thank you.
Fine.
Yes!
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
You haven't seen anything yet.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
You'll ask me to what?
Get out of here, you!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Dead?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Look at this! 
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Thanks...
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Thanks.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Will you come here?
Yes.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
Call you back.
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
After all I've done for you --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
What do you mean -- through?
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Just -- one -- second!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
I won't.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
What did you do with her?
Very simple, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Get the Governor on the phone!
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
I give that marriage six months.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Would.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
...and six...
It's not the same.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Where?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Jam.
It looks....foreign.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
I know you mean well.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Come on.
A dead one.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
Fucking great.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
How awesome?
Hell yeah.
I'll help ya.
Turn that fucking radio off!
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
There's not enough room.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
I gotta open the gate.
What?
I hear ya.
How's he get around out here?
Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Firefly.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
Where's Bill?
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Who's your Daddy!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Shhhh... you hear that?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Of course not.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
When you were a little French girl?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
I've got some things to tell you.
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Oh, Rosie.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
I'm not sure.
I'm sorry?
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Nathan!
Do you?
What SPF, sweetie?
Flares?
Absolutely.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
That was wonderful!
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Ooka.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Lila?
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Got it.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unn.
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Comin' in or goin' out?
You look different... More relaxed.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
How?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Sit down.
Two.
I got drunk.
A thousand.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
I told you. I got drunk.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
For who?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
You know everybody, don't you?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
They're fine.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Want some free advice?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I feel tight -- but good.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
A son.
Yeah. Just like that.
How much?
What time?
Yeah. Sure.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Yes.
Can I buy you another drink?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I could always get us a bottle.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You want to go with me?
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Well, he owns things.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Is that a fact?
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
So do you, Fast Eddie.
No.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Where you lived with them.
You're not them.
I only protect myself -- !
What do you mean?
Yes.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Please.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Was there anything over the hill?
I'll take you to school.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
Why, yes.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Better be. You left me for him.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
What's the bad news?
Haven't you been watching?
Just do it!
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Not really...
It's perfect the line is busy?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
I don't hear no fat lady.
Dick-weed!
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
You've got it!
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
The Name of God...
Tapestries?
How dare he?!
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
What were they looking for?
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
All I have to do is scream.
Good point.
I came here to save you.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Dad!
...the solution presents itself.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
It's a new experience for me.
Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
That was seven hundred years ago.
But, Indy --
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Who are you?
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
You don't like him do you?
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Behind you!
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
What do you mean -- how?
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
It's starting to let go!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Oh really?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
A what?!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yes.
Yes, they believe you.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
I know you did!
Who's you?
I'm...inside you.
Why not.
This candid camera?
Your name is Al...
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Do me a favor, Al.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Outrun them.
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
I am. You are.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'm not gonna make it easy.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
Nothing!
Good. Get to a phone.
Use my credit cards.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Just get there.
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What was?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Just hold them close and stay still.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Don't get too cute.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Voice stress analyzer.
Is that all?
You get time off to sleep.
You found her.
That's not funny.
Relax. Let me do this.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
You were with GRUNER!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Aim what?
What exactly?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
Keep thinking.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
Don't give her your name.
Good.
Then how did you know?
**?!! 
He's not an ordinary man.
It is to me too.
When you do...
Do what?
Oh.
What did you say?
Oh...I can't. Business.
Like there's someone else here.
Why?
...I...don't know.
As if your mind's not all there.
Can I help?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You did.
Trans Ocean Travel.
Wanted to get to know you.
You seemed interesting.
You work for Ryuji?
Were you working for him last night?
What's he done?
One chip?
Where would you go to sell a chip?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Sure I can, can't I?
What'd...you forget?
It was my choice.
Her?
It was you.
Yes.
The other working.
So we better get started.
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
I heard them.
I'll be there.
What? Forget it.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Sure.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
I'm not touching my film...
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Is there any more rice...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
I didn't want to leave it there...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
Use the bathroom.
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
It would be better if he called us.
Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Alright. What did you think?
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Black, black...
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
No? No, what?
That's not the point.
I told the truth... I told the truth.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
You called me.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Well, I wouldn't say --
Here. Got pictures.
So she's uh, flourishing?
I had no idea until after, but --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
What part?
We rest, Your Honor.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
It's your move, Miles.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
He wants a reconciliation.
Well, don't look at mine!
Absolutely.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Oh right. You met Patricia.
No, we're not!
I want... I want to...
Did you just propose to me?
Yes.
Yes. Again.
I have a watch.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
No buts. Now. Out.
Please! Leave the house.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
You have some?
We do have a man for you.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Ha Ha.
We've outlined a settlement...
Now Rex.
Nothing?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Miles -- why so angry?
HA!
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Who's "Patty."
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Come in. Sit down.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Why? Do you know him? 
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Maybe they doand maybe they don't.
Yes.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
I never thought of that.
Shut up!
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Like what?
I'll find it myself.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
What do you meanstarvation?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
This isn't "piggy-back."
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
What!
knowbut
Here. Eat your head off.
Hitch-hiking.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
What if nobody stops for us?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Mind your own business.
We don't need forty cars.
Come onget in.
Come on! come on! 
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Well, I am.
Why, he'll be back.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
What time is it?
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Get out!
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Send it collect.
Who?
Wife?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Five G'sor I crab the works.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah. Just babies.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Street cats?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Get home my ass.  We're going to the office, have another drink.  I want some company tonight.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
You're not digging.
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
You still questioning any Cubans?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Why?  What's wrong?
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Four to six.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I know.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Take a look across the street.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Between six and seven seconds.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
How many men are working with you on this?
Yes.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
How'd you know where he was?
Hey, Jackie.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
Thanks.
Can you do it or not?
What's her name?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Why does it need to be dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
He's got that kinda money?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
Are you?
How'd you feel about it?
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I go back to work tomorrow.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Has he hinted around?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
What if I've figured a way?
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I told him I might.
Spain.
I thought you were tired of your business?
I beg your pardon?
Do you live together?
Not every day?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
A Broadway shopping bag.
You talk to him?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
Not in the fitting room.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
Buy ya a beer?
It looks good on you.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
I understand woman, damn!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
What did they say?
I can do that.
Who?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
Where at?
Uh-huh.
Really, I'm impressed.
No thanks.
Fourteen.
Where were you?
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
Sure.
Uh-huh?
Are you sweating?
You sure?
Okay.
I follow.
What does that mean?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
I shot her.
Where did you shoot her?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
That's right.
It's in there.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
What does she do for you?
Beaumont worked for you.
Winston found you.
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
She's been there since Thursday night.
Have her bring the money here.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She will.
I know where to turn.
Uh-huh.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
'Ola!
No problem.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
What isn't happening?
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Yeah, ever since that ...
You're hurting me!
They're not interested, Jake.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
It's cold.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
He told me he was going to Hell.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I saw Sarah the other day.
What?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
It's good to see you.
Ah!
No.  I see them.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Carlson? Is he new here?
New? He's been here for years.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
No. Don't move me.
Where is the lamp?
Thanks.
Yeah, but for what?
A good lay.
She looked good then.
Well, you didn't marry her.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
What's wrong?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Hey, I'm here.
He did? When?
I don't believe this.
Let go!
I want to know. You tell me!
It might be for me.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Goddamn you!
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Nothin' much.
I need to see you, Jake.
I need to see you.
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Why not?
Everywhere, like a plague.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
How did it happen?
No one knows. They say it blew up.
You got lucky.
Alright, asshole.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
Where'd you get the gun?
The hull's imploding!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Fuckin A...
I'm pulling, damnit!
We have to get off this ship.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
And what happend to ...?
Eat me.
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
I get it.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
Oh I like her a lot.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
I'm on my way.
Well, do something!
Close the fucking door!
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
You're leaving me here alone?
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Ow!
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I gotta go back.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
Are you finished?
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Old Earth?
Exactly.
Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
Just a favor for your old man.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
It's my charter. My party.
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
What d'ya mean?
Rogue?
You could say that.
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You from around here?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You're leaving?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Let me see your hands...
Anti-Shark cage.
Ever see one like this?
And I'll drink to yours.
No way! He can't!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
I don't know...
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I totally heard you did.
What?
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yeah. That was me.
What, you mean as friends?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
What a trip, man.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You don't know anything about me!
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Shut up.
What do you play?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
You don't have to do that.
Why? What the big deal?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Nothing.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
That is sick, man.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I'm pregnant.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Hm.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
So you don't do any of those things.
Hold still.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Brian.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Yeah.
A... I gotta go.
I heard that.
Take your time.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
...Brian hurt his foot.
...You're hurting me...
Without his car?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Yes!
Did what take?
And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
He looks like my uncle.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
That.
What are you talking about?
Why not? You stink.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
At the block party?
Yeah?
How do you know?
Nothing?
Of course I do.
No...
Because your a virgin?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
No.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
No, I didn't bleed.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Good luck.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
That's right.
Shh.
You want a wip-it?
Yeah.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
What are you saying?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
The door was open.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
What's the first street?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Where is she?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
How?
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
You're next move should have been e2- e3.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Of course not.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
I just can't believe it.
You're losing me.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Has he gotten through to any?
Any sign of rape?
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
It's important.
Anything else?
This ain't no photo.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
That's a big area to cover.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Maybe I already have.
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
That's got to be it.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Is it serious?
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
What are they, please?
Uh huh.
Sounds very violent.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Another kind of game?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Because I think he's wrong.
She died in a car accident.
I'm not playing a game now.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
For emphasis?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
It's not that easy.
Of course not.
Are you going to come tonight?
I'm not nervous.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
About what?
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You must move away from the Center.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
There is no other way.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You have not slept in two days.
What do you see?
But you suspect.
Can she be forced?
Never.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Let us wish him peace.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
No! You cannot know that!
Let me comfort you.
You will not, then?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
I know you.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
So your sons will speak of you to your grandsons, and your grandsons to their grandsons.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
That I promise you.
A flicker of talent.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
A small house.
I have a cinnamon bar.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
I don't think it's working.
Look at its insides.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Then look!
He will not!
Then he will die!
A match for your son, I think.
Yes. We lost five.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
But you would not stay with me.
Of what?
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
...What?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Now, try a running guy.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
When I say I love you.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...I got lost, Mister.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
...No... he's my lover...
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Where?
Maybe later.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
How serious is it?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
How long does this... Mania last?
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
There was no card.
The new store?
Show me.
Please tell me.
That's okay -- really it is.
Pacifica, California.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Nine.
This is the route approved by triple A.  Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
The Gazette's small huh?
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
I told you.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
She never ate a slice.
You're amazing.
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Coffee?
No.
Hello.
Are you working?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Yes.
Very clever.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Can we just forget it?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Yeah... I'd like that.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I have a 4.0.
Go to hell.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Yes. I was washing my hair.
Yes.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Is everything okay?
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I'm so happy for you!
I'm her sister.
Delta. Gamma.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
You guys are so sweet!
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Thank you. I love you, too.
Power yoga?
Josh proposed!
Margot!
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Neat.
Maybe not to your face...
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Projecting joy is not my job.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Are you asking me on a date?
Why not?
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course, I do!
So are you!
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
I completely agree.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
Then what? My boobs are too big?
Harvard. Law school.
See?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --
Where's the Rock?
We go out, smash 'em now?
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
And then?
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
East of Mercia?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
I meant no disrespect.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Something's coming.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Aye!  That too.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
It bodes evil.
I know the rogue, Jack.  Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
There must be some way to get it up there.
That's it!
You're on your own... like a true champion.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
A promise is a sacred oath.
Jack!
I have no wife.
Then, perchance you'll me.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Pinching?  Where?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Dead, dead, dead.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Do I not please you, Jack?
Wondrously so.
That was in jest.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Up ahead!
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
Oh.
Here, honey!
Who are all these people?
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
Where's your dad?
I can't even take a shower here.
I'll get your back.
We're not gonna do anything.
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
You've been good this week.
If that's what it takes.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
What are you on?
how much weight have you lost?
How's your wife?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
He buys and sells the world.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Maybe that's too long.
I hate this job.
From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
George, this is the third time.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
I'm not going!
I'll hate you forever.
I can promise you complete privacy.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
The gloves on the table are for you.
I know.  Why?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Why wouldn't she leave?
Are you taking them still?
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
I still don't know what that means.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Good for you.
I can die trying.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
I love those doors.
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
Let's go.
Do you remember?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Watch out for the smile, boys.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
I'd rather you not be here.
Going on?
You've never said that before.
I need to know.
So could I.
The payoff.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I'll be in the bedroom.
Hey.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Yes, it is.
No, nigger.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Yes, boss.
I'll be right back.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
That's some long green.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
My daddy gave me this watch.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
What gave you that idea?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
He's dead.
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
What'd you say?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Him?
Make 'em throw strikes.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I'm not working on a plan.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I said you're soft.
Yeah? You and what army?
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
How about some steak sauce?
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
It'll be too late.
I prefer bourbon.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Me? Willie Long.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Sure, why not?
Uh. No it won't?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
It would be so okay.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
It's Stanley, sir.
Boogerland!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
You followed him?
Yes, great movie...
I was DeNiro!
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
"Octopus people?"
My perfume?
Good. I was concerned.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
From? From? From?
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
What other food?
And I did it myself right on there.
Just wondered... what happens?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
Here.
Please... No.
I'm not armed.  Well?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
You're sure you don't want to try?
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Of course.
Why tell me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
Please? What friends?
I don't have much time.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
How will they know we're coming?
For us.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Are you sure?
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
Hello.
All right.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Alive?
And all alive you say?
Oh, yes... I think...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
This is our bedroom.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
As best we can.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
Hi.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Yes, I believe so.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Coming up.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
I... I didn't say anything...
FUCKIN' "A".
What night?
Who the hell owns that dog?
Was there?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Who is this?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Sheila...
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
I see.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
Okay, Lovey.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Why, you look beautiful.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
You have no disputes over women?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
108 and still active?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Pardon me
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, dear.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get outporters or no porters!
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Oh, the girl at the piano?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Yes.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Yes.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
Nothing about the porters yet?
All right. Sorry, George.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Oh, George . . .
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Maria?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I was just going to.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
I taught kindergarten.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
You don't know me at all.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
I think that's what's happening...
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
In case I need it.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Yeah ... ?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Nothing.
Cause I think we're looking at it.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
The what?
Fine.  Good.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
They went right to the President.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Agatha...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
What is it?
I know... I do, too...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
It's all I could safely move.
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
Kill type?
For that, we have to go for a ride.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Try again.
I'm fine.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Go back to work.  All of you.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw, it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour, Wally.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
So now I need you to hack into her.
Oh, Sean --
Sean --
I was looking for you...
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
-- and then walk out.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Sean --
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Not quite.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Have you been there recently?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Jesus...
What are you talking about?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
He's great, right. Is he great?
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Come on. Let's go.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
No more.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
I'll support you.
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
When's it going down?
What's that?
Yeah?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Where's Ricky?
That it?
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
Pshhh...
She was fast, huh?
Then what are you saying?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
He'll work it off.
You vouch for him?
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
We get it. We're sorry.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
Good morning.
Where's the drop?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
I'm on the phone.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
He's not here.
So, it was a draw.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Is that the woman from..?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Oh really. Why's that?
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Nothing.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I don't know.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
No.
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Bobby and Ricky.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Cool.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yes.
Excuse me.
'Strapped?'
It means you got a gun?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
That shouldn't be a problem.
How's it going?
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
So you're our own private guy?
No. What is it?
Yes. You're going to New York.
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Keeps me out of the army.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Why?
I'll take your goddam bet.
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
That really you, Red?
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
Where am I gonna start?
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
Come, sit with us.
She ate.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
You have enough worries of your own.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
Did you hear what I said?
Just hold me.
What do you think?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
You have to sleep for three.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Just what is your question?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
If she got eyes, she do.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Tell him about Baldy.
Might be all right.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
I'm the man.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
Are you sure?
I'm not... easy.
I guess that makes you the smart one.
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
I have connections.
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
[What is his name?]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Yes.
Have you used this type before?
It's loaded.
And what if amateurs try it?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
I'm not crying.
My ankle.
In a week you should be fine.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Are you afraid of me?
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Dyslexic?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
No.
Planned what?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Don't forget your towel.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
It's not.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
So am I.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
That's nice.
Oh.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Your son Marty?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
Nothing.
All right.
How do you do?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I'll see you around.
Oh, that's a sad story.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Tomatoes.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
I heard you, Ma.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Well...
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Just one for a start.
How you, Radar?
Or her figger.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
We're a good team.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
An eternal damnation.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Oh, Jesus.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
Something else we have in common.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
You think he won't.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
I didn't have much choice.
You really say the cutest things.
What's the story?
There's only one worth noticing.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Your tent?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
They can't do that to me!
Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Nice.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute . . .
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
Oh!
There is no letter.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
In what man!
John Doe.
What John Doe?
John Doe.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Duets? But can we trust him?
What do you do when you work?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who's got him?
All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
A what?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
Whyuh
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Did you write itor didn't you?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Thanks.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Good night, John.
That's too bad.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
What?
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Good. I don't want to be late.
Clarence Teal.
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
You can't help me, man.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Yep.
I know.
Try to remember that.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
We could fill it with water.
Do you really?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
That it is.
And what about the ones you don't save?
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Scottie...
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Hmm?
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
...the hell are you talking about?
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Depends. What's up?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Who's running it!
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Why --
About what?
Nothing, go back to sleep.
In here I am.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
And what about the reconfiguration?
I'm South Dakota.
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
-- Katie.
Realize?
You weren't real.
Just like that --
There should be a way to open it.
... We must try to communicate with them.
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
About twenty seconds in your time.
Release the power with the power.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Look closer.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
GO IVAN!!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
What's going on?!
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Life knocked me back.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
You're sure?
Have you thought about this?
So what is the problem?
Like a party for all our friends.
How soon can we pull this off?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
I must know more of you, my son.
The name's Charlie.
You get fifteen percent.
They do what I tell 'em.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Masseria's been after me too.
Okay. I'm listening.
Come on. Be polite.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
Well - you'd need a body.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
You want to come inside?
You don't like where I live?
Uh-huh?
Behind the books.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
How about getting married?
Any time.
No.
We're gonna get married.
Okay--I mean--
That infernal phone!
Now, pet--  Jim!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Horace Mill--!
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Than what?
Emma!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will he yield for a question?
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Just fine.
J-Jefferson Smith.
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
I know--but you--you're going to help.
And with your help--
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Committee, huh?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
What?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Thanks very much.
And a *lot* of paper!
Try sitting down.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Have I?
Abigail.
Letitia.
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Must have been tickled pink.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Don't mention it--
Saunders--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
I'm splendid, too.
Ring the call to quorum.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
You can't say *that* to--
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Deeds?
Thank you very much.
Your Honor!
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
I enjoy it.
What did they say?
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
He did? I play the tuba
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Thank you.
In a day or so, I think.
Don't be ridiculous.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
John
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Better wire him right away, John.
But your honor
Hang up.
Are your parents living?
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
No, thanks.
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Entertainment?
Arthur wants to quit!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Yes, sir.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
I write poetry.
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Yes, sir.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
You're Walter, aren't you?
What two policemen?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
What's that?
Why's that?
I think he's got a point.
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
I didn't hear you.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Althea hasn't told you?
What?
I'd better get in there.
Well, come on in.
You're on your own today, honey.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
-- Go on!
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
What do you mean?
Just who is here, can you tell me?
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
No.
Be specific.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's... good?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Transference!
Which show was that?
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Will you wait for me?
Where was this?
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I understand.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
This --
I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
What about everything? How did this happen?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
See you Thursday... regular time.
What?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
And then killing your sister.
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Immune from what?
You shall see.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
What did you do to him!?
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Broad?!
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
Every damn day.
I found sand. I saw death.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
Are you sure?
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Did you ever see him eat?
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
Of course.
What --?
I'm his daughter.
The Disco Boys.
Atta, boy!
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
You're a spy.
Yeah.
What?
Yes.
And you are a fool.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
Are you coming or not?
I can't.
See ya tomorrow.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
But... the silverware?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But how do we get in?
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
What do you mean?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Are you serious?
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Cavalry?
There are none here.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Ah-hh, no.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
How did it spread so quickly?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Were any of them married?
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
All right -- I promise.
Open the door.  It's me.
Goodbye.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
I couldn't face telling you.
Do you know what you're saying?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Yup.
Yes you did.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
You already in.
Naw, you go first.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
It's locked.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Hold on.
Well bring yo' ass on...
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
What?!
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
What?
Good, let's get out.
Nothing.  What you want?
What's the matter?
Elroy.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
I've been a bad boy.
You just come in on Amtrack?
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Aw, too bad.
Yes?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I'd like to know what...
Yes, I'm listening.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Let me talk to her again.
Don't you threaten me.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
No, that's,..that's fine
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
I think you're right.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
How did you see us kiss?
Nods.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
I promise.
Keep it.
What?
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
What are you supposed to do?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
What are you going to do now?
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Fuck you!
What?
I've got something for you.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Come with me, honey.
Just put her on.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Twenty-five wives!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
John don't like him much.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
There! What's so hard about that!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
You what?
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
He ain't my Dad.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
Answer me!
My flesh and blood!
Where's she at?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
This man down at the Drugstore...
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Jesus.
Who was scary?
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Not really.
You believe in anything?
How you plan to do that?
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
I don't mean her --
Right.
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
No.
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
You should be more careful, Anna.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
What was it like?
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
What is it, Anna?
Just for the honeymoon.
Possibly.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
That's right.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
I'll send you a muff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Comrade Kopalski...
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
A cow?
Yes, monsieur.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Business.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
I think so too.
At what intervals does he whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
It's twelve o'clock.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Then how did you get here?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Just smile.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Then you should go back to your table.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Ninotchka, I love you.
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Yes, sweetheart. 
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Did you win?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
Yes.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
I must ask you to leave.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I must insist that you leave.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Unfortunately.
May I have your bags, madame?
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes.
May I ask why?
Please... sit down.
No.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Then his office will be fine.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Son of a bitch.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
What?
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Why me?
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Yeah?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Why not?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
... go on.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
I don't have a pistol.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
So?
Can we get around this, Al?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
Their fourth!
Fucking hell.
We were working on China.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
What?
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
When I met with him, he said ...
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
I always get my man.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
The White House.
You're fucking me.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
The American people put me where I am.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
There's no other choice.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
How a fat man gets so many girls.
Yes, Mr. President.
You don't think he was a hero?
Did you cry when he died?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
How about Kissinger along with him?
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
That was a long time ago.
Ernie Davis.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
Fire him.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Anything.
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
They're all your enemies?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Thank you.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
There'll be time for that.
You heard it?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
How fresh is this coffee?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
How come're you doin that?
You don't know what he thinks.
Nineteen zero and nine.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
No ID in her room?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
Not word one.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Believe you're right.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
How's that, Sheriff?
Don't hurt no one.
What do you think.
It's full a money.
Yeah.
What're you goin' to do?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Yes ma'am?
What makes you say that?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
You expect him?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
No me mate.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
See about closing.
You married into it.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
I didn't put nothin' up.
No.
...Where you want me to put it?
You already have the tent?
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
You want to change rooms?
I do like you.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm retired.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Oww! My arm, careful!
A woman can write a check.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
You must be joking.
Oh, this is wonderful...
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm sorry.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yes, ma'am.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
Maroon.  I stole it.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
No, Del.
What happened when you were twelve?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Yes... maybe it was.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
That is a skill!
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
How did you know?
Dr. David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
The Five?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
I was talking about what you could wear!
What? Where was he?!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Umm...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Deranged. That would be the right word.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
...who doesn't?
"Injuns?"
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I'll think about it.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Her show?
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
That ain't it!
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Suckin' away.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Not out the other side his face, though.
You -
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Blooey!
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Who gave you this idea?
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Aw screw it...
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Louder!
Is your brother a flyer?
Sid, there's no baby.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
I got my foot on the floor.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I've never had a girl.
It sure was.
What's stopping you?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Are those for me?
No. Is that what you want?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Because he's my friend, too.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
You finish.  Then we finish.
Get the fuck away from me.
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
I did.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
The hell we are.
Open the door.
0150.
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Little bit.  Yeah.
I don't know, why?
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
He WILL.
What?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
What's with you?
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Judge, calm down.
I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost.  We all lost.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
So talk...
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know about that.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
And who is we?
Just a kid.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just the legit shit.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
Ain't no one seen him.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I don't know. I really don't.
No.
Congratulations.
Uh... uh... I...
That would be nice, too.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
You know how old I am.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
No...
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
I don't care.  I hate him.
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
I stand corrected.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
Thank you.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
Worse.
God willing.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Bite?
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Because you promised.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
What?
Why? For God's sake, why?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Wendigo?
Yes.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
This babe has said enough.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
I'm thinking about going to bed.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
All right then.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Boy overboard!
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
That would hardly be proper.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
If I had known --
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
That we are.
Smith.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Pirate.
Because you're a pirate.
Agreed!
We need to go!
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
He's not telling the truth.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Still --
A moment.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
You're not rotting meat.
No, Icky, this is real.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
You don't want this.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
A man?
What did he want?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Yeah, we'll see.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
What waste?
What do these replicators do to people?
Isn't it already too late then?
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
It's still inside me?
Getting used to it.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Oh yes you are!
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Is that so?
As one Tribune man to another
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah - go on.
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
No?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
You're my what?
Oh no, sir!
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Yes sir!
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Here you are.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody
She did?
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
Heavens! The man's insane!
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
Yes, sir.
No, sir!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Well sir, I'll show you.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Ah.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
No ... They won't be able to tell.
Thanks.
Here's my favorite.
Sure you are.
Where are you gonna go?
I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Lover's Lane!
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
So.
What's the matter?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Oh, no thanks ...
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
It's not in ME.
Oh sure it is.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No way.
As a matter of fact he does.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
What?
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Right.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
We'll just put up the top.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
What department store did they go to?
What the hell's going on!
COME BACK!!!
Well c'mere, young fella.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
No you're not.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Just listen to me ...
Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
... What's that?
Christmastime.
Yeah.
Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Call me later.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Where are you?
...just talking to you....
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Hi....what....what's up....?
You're going to work now?
Can I ask you a question?
Really? Please?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
I don't know.
Yeah.
Ok.
Yes I do.
Yeah, not really.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Really?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
So that was your pudding?
Did something happen; are you alright?
...yes I did...?
Are you learning how to play it?
...yeah...
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
Yeah?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Did you do it?
No.
Well who did?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Sorry.
Barry Egan.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
No one will know your name.
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I'll say whatever I want --
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Mhm.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
Ok. You're connected.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Let's just leave it there for now.
...I'll tell you later.
You have another house somewhere or something?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Well....what do you want, then?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Ok.
Are you sure?
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Ok.
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Mother's not half so blind as you.
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
THEN BUGGER ME!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- the passion in your heart --
I know, because I felt it myself --
NEVER!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
It's a formality; truly.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
No. It most certainly was not.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
But I am history.
Yes?
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
....shame on you, truly...
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Not you too
You're just scared.
Am I?
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mm.
I can't
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The actor
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Yeah
You know that can't happen.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
How much?
Yes.
I wanted it
I will not have this in my home.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Like a bug.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
I expected more from you.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
Christ.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Yeah, you're probably right.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
Yes
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
He's Christ?
For what?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
How can he embarrass you?
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Hit me in the face.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Well, I heard some things.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
You sound bitter.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
Three more, I figure.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Should I hit it?
Jake...
Oh, Jake.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
What'd you see?
I am answering...
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I don't know.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
He has it. Thank you.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can't do that.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Ever get an answer?
Your logic is backward.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
For getting rid of that cast.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Yeah.
I don't want to.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Is what you want something you can discuss?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
That's the hard part.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Got a shovel?
Smart girl.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Mrs. Doyle?
You haven't even heard from him?
Not a word.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Three.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Something too frightful to utter.
There's nothing to see.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
The same.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
How?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
L. B. Jefferies.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Good luck, Buzz.
Somebody find him a knife.
I like you, you know?
Down in back.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
No.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
We don't have time.
Well, now--
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You're absolutely right!
You don't want me to go.
That's right!
What's that pounding?
Are you going down there?
Plato.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
What?
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
We'll take it!
I've got a gun.
You sure?
I shot at one of them.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
No.
Leave me alone.
Try the desk.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Yes, ma'am.
Who lives?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
I'm numb.
See, we're very modern.
Should we explore?
You smell like baby powder.
We have to go back!
Okay.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Hi.
He hates me.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
No.  Why?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
We're talking, aren't we?
We sell children's toys --
Negative five?
No, hey, I like your coat --
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
What.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
...maybe I die for Nick...
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
What?
He says he wants it now.
What are you talking about?
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
What?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
Her brother.
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
More than you know.
I don't steal any --
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
What?
Cancer-sucker.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
Fuckin' freezing.
How do we do that?
Oh, man --
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
Alamo...
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
And you set me up.
Do what?
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
I gave them me.  Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
There is no other table --
They changed the layout.
Yes.
Fine, now.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
Who?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Pam Grier.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Who, Mr. White?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
What?
Mr. Brown?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
I don't like alarms.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What?
No shit?
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
What are you gonna do about him?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
They're stragglin'.
Thanks.
I'll make the soap myself.
Will she be dark or fair?
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
A little hot.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Good thing you didn't.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Three men on matched roans?
Nobody asked you to.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Depends on how good you drive.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
I don't like to see you go.
Now where's she goin'? --
Up the trail.
What for?
I sure would.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
I was doin' both. Here.
Steve --
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
No. Try a little higher.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Oh.
She killed herself a week before he died.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Not in a thousand years.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
Are these all the subjects?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
That one.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
Just a little experiment.
Of course. So sexy.
Thanks, handyman.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yes.
Then let us prepare.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Always the dentist.
Why?
That's right.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
That's nice.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
I beg your pardon?
Who is this?
It's not fair!!
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
It's sugarless.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?
There is one big problem though.
Certainly not!
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
Are we leaving?
Yes you are.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
You could go and open the door.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
What were you talking about?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Good.
Goodnight, Mary.
Who the devil is he?
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Yes.
Devil worshippers!
But it's a small room, Jason.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
She was my patient.
I've lost my knack.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I think it's time.
Perhaps
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
But she was here?
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
She's very beautiful.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
What?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
False alarm.
Television?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
You are?
What?
I can see that. What are they?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Who's Donna?
Yes.
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
You know?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
No.
On tape?
No.
How come?
Subtlety?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
No.
Are you having an affair?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
But I'm not.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
What?
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Yes.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
What upsets you about that?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
What visitor?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
I have a pretty good idea.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know.
Apparently.
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I feel like I do.
Nope.
Spooked.
You just want to ask me questions?
I just want to ask you questions.
Yes.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Very much live.
Different.
No? Not even one more?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
So make an exception.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Could be risky.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
You are scum. I'll be there.
Right now.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
I wish you hadn't done that.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
Did he put you up to this?
God, you... you're mean.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Will you lease month-to-month?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
John Millaney.
He said immediately.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Do I get a kiss?
Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
No. I don't think so.
Down to the incinerator.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Yes?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Fools!
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
Why Janet?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He was adopted you know.
Who?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Me?
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Do you really think so?
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
No.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Bye.
I love you.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
You got it.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
So you're going to stop acting?
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
How do you know?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
I want to go home now.
I'm a quick learner.
You have the keys.
I'm fine!
Did you drink and dial?
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Count me out.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Nope.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
With Maya.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Let me use your phone.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
That was quite a day yesterday.
Back at you.
You were wearing your belt.
That's what I'm having.
Hey.
She got anything good?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
What about me?
Okay. See you around.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Yeah.
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Ken.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Right.
She doesn't answer me either.
This one?
No dad!
My ballet recital.
That's weird.
Good.
...Tell Graham --
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
What time is it?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Yes.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Don't call me Father.
What was the first thing?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
You'll lose the signal!
They'll find a way in.
Your next water ain't for three days.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Have to.
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Ten A.M.
I'll be long gone.
You got no idea what they were after?
It's not going to be easy.
No hard feelings.
Oh, I was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
Who?
What about the law?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
And a pretty lady.
Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
He is now.
Howdy.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
What makes you think I could?
Where's Emmett now?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
You've got a legitimate job.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
This is a lot of money.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Good-bye.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
Why isn't she with you?
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
She'll drive herself.
I'll send you her resume.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
What about it?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
You really think so?
That's true.
She doesn't want pity.
Really?
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
Hello, is this Elaine?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Really?  She didn't mention it.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
I need flesh and --
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
You saw that?
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
No, that was me.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Long live the First Amendment.
You're in breach.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
No.
Next time I won't be scared of you.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
That I'm a freak.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Upset words.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
So who moved it?
Maybe.
A lady. She died.
They scare me too sometimes.
They talk to you?
Stop it!
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
How'd he know I'd come?
Meaning?
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Which street corner?
I didn't do anything --
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Manure... is life.
Metaphysical question, man.
Hi Suze.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
People say he was a murderer.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
What's wrong?
The audience!
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Then why go back now?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
It's you. You and your father.
No --
Listen to me --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Spider.
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Whatcha' doin'?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
That wasn't a good night, no.
I'm sorry.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
I got to leave my post.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
What can I do you for?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Sure you do.
That's disrespectful.
I loved you. I loved --
Your what?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Eyes on the road.
Uh-oh.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
But you'll do it?
You sure do.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
How'd you know?
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Go.
Yeah?
Why are we doing this?
They're jammed!
What's your twenty?
I hate to say it...
Bandit?
I'll believe it when I see it.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm cucumber cool.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Where the hell are you?
How's your twenty?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Chickenshit money.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
I left him a message.
Okay.
I am. Yeah.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...So you made another deal?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
I don't see it like that at all.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Got hit twice.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Security's locking down the elevators.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I want to hear your version.
Why would you let her to do that?
You fucking bastard...
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Rheya.
To who?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
And tonight?
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You talk like an actor.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
If you're here.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Rheya --
Don't call me that.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You never said you wanted one.
I can't stay here.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
Am I really her?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Why do you say that?
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I'll come with you.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
No dog.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Oh God, that's great!
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
I'll think about Wednesday.
I know.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
She's got to identify him.
I'd identify him.
I might stop you.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
What was that?
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
I got you a present.
Get away from me, freak!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
How about tomorrow?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
I don't think he wants me to find him.
Even if they're not clever.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
You should write that one down.
Strong...
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
See?  You big dullard.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
I don't care.  Cretin.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
You stink, Sefton!
That's right.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Yes, sir.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
A little weak today.
Borscht?
You told them, Hoffy.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
You can tell Father Murray to --
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Just what makes you so popular?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
What time?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
Yes, you do!
How many do you want? A thousand?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
Just don't drool on it.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Twelve years, sir.
Commander.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
On screen.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Soran?
Where is he now?
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
Where are the deflector relays?
Is there a problem?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Not from here, no.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
... How long?
You said there wouldn't be any.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
What's wrong?
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
What? What are you saying?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Count on our help, sir.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Yes... But -- how...?
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
From yourself, Admiral.
Ah.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Carol!
Is that a poem?
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
Ssssh!
Never mind! Hurry!
What do you want with us? I demand --
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
I don't know.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Aye, sir.
Scotty, let's have it.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
It would explain a great many things --
Affirmative, Admiral.
A distinct possibility.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Spock...!
Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command.
And why not?
It is still regulation, Admiral.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
The question is irrelevant.
Where must you go?
I do this because I was there,
I would accept that as an axiom.
It'll come back to him.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
I was not informed about observers.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
We are launching everything we have.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Iowa.
Go ahead.
... You're very perceptive.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Right.
... You have a point...
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Whales?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Why not?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Picture, please.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
If you'll follow me, Professor --
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
... Are you joking?
Just use the keyboard...
The keyboard... How quaint.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
For someone so young.
There are caves in those mountains.
We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...  But they will not make it easy to get there...
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Sometimes I do.
Do machines ever play?
No, I mean...
For what purpose?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Understood.
Good luck. Dougherty out.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
On screen.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Transferring controls to manual.
What are they interested in...?
Good question.
What...?
Or you could try lying down.
... I'm not sleeping well...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Yes...
That'll be interesting.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Do it.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Always am.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
What's still there?
We're crossing the threshold!
Invasion.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm very sorry.
You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet?
How did you know about that?
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
Onscreen.
Worf... torpedo... now!
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
What kind of message?
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
We're not finished.
Are we playing multiple choice?
More than ever.
Spock's looking for us...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
I'm not sure how to take that.
WHAT HAPPENED?
The drink WAS served...
Yes.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Shields up. Battle stations.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Kronos, sir?
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
I always wanted to try that.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Not yet... Section 4236...
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
I believe you. Please...
Confirmed, Captain!
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
Sir?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
A computer canna lie, sir.
Nevertheless.
What exactly does that mean?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
Now, you make a toast.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Negative.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Make it so.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Do you have life support?
What do we know about the population?


Aye, sir
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
What's this all about?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Not so long.
He is what his life has made him!
But you want to.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Silence, Romulan!
And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
What do you do?
It is beautiful.
Stay right there...
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
Clarify that.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Dashboard.
Yes.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
No.
What is hitchhike?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
You want this ticket?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Can I have the gun?
It's bad.
I am your friend.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
I understand.
Yes, they are.
But...
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
I will.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Bullshit!
You know that's impossible!
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Forget it's there.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Maybe.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Least you can do.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
Naawww.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
What clip?  What was it?
I already got everything I need from you.
Strickland.
Fumitsu.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
You'll see.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Never really thought about it.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
It's not your fault.
That's where it gets a little strange.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Well, look at the plus side.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
No.  It didn't.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Exactly.  That's why it's a make- able deal.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
No, sir.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Who knows.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Winona.
A grill pattern.
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not as much as you'd think.
What's wrong with me?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
What about his killer?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Maybe cause he's smart.
Its called insubordination.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
How long ago?
I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way.
Dick Low's a killer too.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Five months. I love it.
Doesn't fit.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
They're all criminals?
You got a point there.
What's that?
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
Sue Ann Hanson.
Start killing people for real?
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Yeah, of course.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
You? You went by the book?
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
I want to help you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Speck is dead.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
It's over for you.
Are you calling Her?
What do you drive?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
Are you sure? Maybe...
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
How was it hard?
How?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
You have to lay it on the table.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...The red piece of shit over there...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Well that sucks.
It's a gig.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
Why?
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I didn't mention her once today.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
What's the point?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
I don't know...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
You're crazy.
Wait.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
She smiled, baby.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
That's bullshit.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
Christy was nice...
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Minnie Pearl.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
That doesn't matter.
What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
No...
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
Our little baby's growing up...
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Like hell I will.
OK, but be careful.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
For killing a man.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Yes.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
I'm German-Irish.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
Michael...
Michael, I love you.
Can you say it?
Huh?
How's Mom?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
To the city.
Maybe.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Do you recognize my voice?
Sure. Any time.
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
You'd say if you mind?
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Can you mix a martini?
I met him in New York.
Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
What?
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
Relax.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Is Freddie here?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
So tell me.
How?
Sure.
Who is it?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
What about Cortina?
I'll go.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Where's Dickie?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
What?
That's a terrific idea.
And you, sir? Any better?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
I can explain.
Shut up! Shut up!
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
What?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
You know what -- I am.
A ragione. A ragione. 
It's okay.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
He's already angry, I don't think --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Even your fiance...?
What about Thomas Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
I don't remember the exact date.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You have, yes.
That's an expensive gun.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Huh?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
You want to canvass?
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
My name is Travis.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
The moon?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I'm leaving.
Huh?
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Just what?
No, why?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
And what happened?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
I have.
Nah.  I suppose not.
You looking for some action?
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
What's your real name?
You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
I... I don't get along with people like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
My work may take me out of New York.
Yes I am.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Military record?
No, I want long shifts.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
O.K., cowboy.
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Neither do I, I guess.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
It's all I could think of.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Partners.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Whatever happens.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Damn...
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
I'm sorry.
I don't smoke?
Oh.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
No kidding.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Good to meet you.  Again.
Thanks.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Can't wait.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
What.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Huh?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
I know.  A Purple Heart.
You can't testify.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
What do you mean?
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
I taught you that.
No, I...
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Of course.
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
Yes.  Very.
Cathy?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
I think so.
What do you mean?
When was this?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then go.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Are you coming to my party?
What's the matter with them?
I don't know, honey.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Try my best.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Of course.
What name?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Yes?
Thank you.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
Well, you're the lawyer. 
Yes, very.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
Oh, my God, look at her!
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I wish I could be that way.
I don't mind, really.
Did you close the door?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
No, of course not.
Some of them are.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Maybe.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
Why?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Yes.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Are you staying?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Maybe.
What time is it?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
You said three o'clock.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
These weren't a few birds.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
To...  To kill them.
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
But can't you give me any idea?
Good morning.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
MacFarlane
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
I remember her.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
We can't be sure of that.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
What?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I've had some experience.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
No great lady will ever take my place?
Aye.
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
You sent them. I had no choice.
You're wrong.
Tell her... we'll get him.
We won't.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I was hoping you'd find out.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
I was talking about you.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
Someone else did it.
I don't want to see!
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
You mean Alex.
Watch out!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No foolin'? Will you?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
Just Klaatu.
About five months -- your months.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
You ready?
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Come on in.
What about him?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It won't work.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
Zero.
The meanest!
That's right.
Star?...
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Hey, take it easy.
With him?
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I will, David!
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
Sam, don't --
Closet monster!?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
You better not like him too much.
I'll pass.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
No, I'm not...
Mom!
Lucy.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Okay.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
So do I!
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
You're right... not even to mention you and me.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Anybody sick?
Finish what?
You promise?
What?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
When we were up poking around his place... I found this...
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
What clothes?
Maybe we shouldn't.
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
I think so.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
A serum test possibly.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Screw the generator!!
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Where?
No...
But you're only a mud carrier.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Do you know which way?
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
As slaves.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
It can't all be like this...
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
So you take their best...
No...
No...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
Dance with me...
Trust me...
All right, what is it now?
Holding you... again.
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
Perseverance.
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
I would.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
That's absurd --
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
Sir...?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
Or mud carriers.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara...?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
Imagine that.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Sir --
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
New Yorkers.
He said he traveled for two months.
Why?
My father has gone to a better place.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
Depends on what you're seeing.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Yes.
[Beat] You're his son?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
I never touched your father! I swear!
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Our car won't start.
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Please...
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You think Lorenson kills you?
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
They're not.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
I guess I'd ask you why.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
The future doesn't look different?
And how do you know that?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
I wasn't talking about anything.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, I'm ok.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
Uh-huh.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Alright.
Tell us about him.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
A .38.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
A regular outlaw.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Okay.
Maybe.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Am I in trouble?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Which part?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Yes.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You're not touchin' that car.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Will I be?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
She thinks he's a pig.
Yes!  I believe I am!
Try to.
What for?
Let's get it over with.
Just past Boise City.
You mean now or before?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Shoot the radio!
Hit it.
Yes.
Yeah, you want it?
What'd I say again?
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
You're drivin'.
What in the hell is that up there?
Then let's not get caught.
Fuck that.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
You got a brew?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Big time.
Ahh.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Same here again.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
A surprise?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Nah, really, it was moronic.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
She's blackmailing you, right?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Really?  Very, very?
So you found Mary?
No, not at all.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Oh my.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
You bet.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
You were following us?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Puffy, get over here.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Oh yeah.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
I wish.
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
No, that's really unneces --
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow...
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Yeah.
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Yeah.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I don't know. I don't know.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
James Looks Twice?
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
How'd you know?
Alright. Alright.
Yes.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Cuz I want New York.
Bullshit.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
A what?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
What do you mean?
Stop.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
That's right. Turn around.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
I could be, too.
And on to a bigger one with you?
I heard of one once.
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Not in this case. CHARLIE  You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
Uh hum.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
What plane.
I'm different.
Make what?
You're horrible
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Well no...inverse order.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
That's what I want.
Hardly ever.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
...Something like that.
F-14's sir.
Yes sir!
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
I can recover. Hold on!
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
What do you want?
Why do they call you Wolf?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Got you here.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
This is Maverick.
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
So have I.
Three guesses.
Sir?
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I lost.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Fuck you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
We haven't implanted it yet.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
At Rekall.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Any news of Quaid?
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Rekall?
I did?
Up to the right.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
What the hell is this?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Bye.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
I love you.
Blondes.
I think it's still hungry.
Forget I said wife.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Aliens built it.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, I was wondering if we could...
Howdy, Rhonda.
Well, sure.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Great.  Thank you.
I think we wait right here.
Yeah, geography.
You okay?
Correct.
It most certainly is.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
You can't remember that -- !
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not at all --
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
-- an angel dust dealer --
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
...Are you sure we want that?
"Have to"? No...
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Racist asshole came at me.
...Okay...
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Calls for speculation.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
-- Eddie told you?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Tell me about the letter.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
What happened to her?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
We're heading into a difficult situation.
I'll explain it to you. Do you remember Lil's dance?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
You didn't do your homework?
When?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Call me.
Of course...
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
No, I want to smoke.
You want a muffin?
Donna, you are a muffin.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
When am I going to see you?
No.
You're getting warmer.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Mom, take it easy.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Fine.
Your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
You're right. There's no one here.
There's no one here.
I'm fine.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
You thought it was just.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
I... yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
I completely understand...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I... um...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
'Code Blue'...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
The most respected...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yes.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I had a witness disappear on me.
What?
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Exception!
Really. How wonderful for you.
Yes. It was, actually.
Laura.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Isn't there something you...
I...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes. Price...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Nothing happened.
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
I'm swell.
Yeah.
We got to talk.
I don't want a mistrial.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
Don't let's lose each other.
It might give us something.
No.  I thought you had them.
They'll probably move at dawn.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
You get any sleep last night?
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
Just be careful, okay?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
I'll be there in three hours.
Diabetes?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
Coming for you...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Yes?
Listen, dammit.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
What's that?
Captured?  How?
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
Me?  Why me?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
I can take it.
Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
I thought this was your dream come true.
I guess.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Me too.
Yes.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Come on man, what'd they look like?
How do you know?  They might.
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
I know.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Shut up donut.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I figured it out.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
About yourself?
Long enough.
You've gotta be kidding?
What makes you so sure it was one?
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Get out.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Used to.
Club Zanzibar.
No sir...
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Didn't he say somethin'?
No, he picked me up.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
I guess.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I do.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Oh shit...
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
No radio or TV...
Yeah?
Love you, too.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
I'll bet.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Yes.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Whattya mean?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
Tripp, where the hell...
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Maybe... I don't know.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...
Evidently.  Coming!
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
Do you know he won't expel him?
The last month maybe.
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
What are we going to do with...
She is. Ah. Here we go...
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
The bus station.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
Near Carvel?
Yes, James.
I thank you.
Oh. Well. I...
Who does?
No, it's not that, it's...
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
I'm pregnant.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Did you confess?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
James Leer.
I think I might have.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
And you're old.
Does he still love you?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Oh?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
As a heart attack.
I was thinking of you.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Just kidding.
I haven't heard of half of those.
I told her all my relatives are good- looking.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
When can I see her?
Huh?
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
The mother sure has her hands full.
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
I have friends.
Cop.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Do you believe in them?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I could take you downtown.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
Yeah.
Can I ask how old you are?
Yes?
Robin, listen to me.
It's all the same.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
I don't understand.
It was just an idea.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I don't.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I said I was sorry.
You mean my problem?
That's not a helpful answer.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
But roughly, how old?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What else?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Time.
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
I thought you were a dyke.
What?
You're damaged.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
What?
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
It's been a while since...
Is that all?
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
You don't really --
Yeah.
Fucking liar.
Piece of cake, baby.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Who then?
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Give me that!!
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
More so than the shark?
And why haven't they left each other?
And how do you explain that?
Yes, very much so.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes, maybe that is better.
Then why do you say them?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
That's why I asked you...
Why?
Why?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Do you consider that a compliment?
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
What do you think?
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
And what did they say about me?
Unfortunately, no.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Is that far from here?
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
You really must do me this one favor.
Yes.
Who told you this?
Who tells you these things?
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
It made them holy.
Yes.
And you like that?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
No. I was sick.
And what happened?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
No.
Why do you smoke?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What else did she tell you?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
Who?
You'll laugh.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Not my fault.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
Yes.
She can.
How?
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
How does she know that?
Who am I?
I had a baby.
She made me promise not to.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
I hate them.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Yes.
I have to throw up...
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Go away, I don't want you here.
Frightened.
Why?
So I could go to him.
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
I hate him for what he did to me.
She took the baby in her arms?
Thanks...
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
You have proof?
The one up on the third floor?
Who told you this?
I can beat that.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Who was the father?
Could there have been anyone else?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
The science of psychiatry.
I am not with the Inquisition.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I am...
What?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Sister Paul?
And Agnes' father?
She molested her!
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  Lots of dirty little secrets.
I'd like yours too.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Nothing...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
And what has that to do with it?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Right...
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
You're saying God did it?
Why would I lie?
You tied the cord around its neck.
Then she's a liar.
She can't remember.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
The cards... you're bank.
Eight and two thirds.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Well --
Are you now?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
I'm a deserter, too.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Spoil sport!
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I beg your pardon?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Follow your impulse.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Aye, I knew you were.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
What are you?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
And what's it all come to in the end?
I'll look after meself.
Every morning.
But I'm clean.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Here, Pauly.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Hello.
Is it?
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Oh, leave off!!!
Y'what?
Who?
Down the ... er ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
What's up?
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Dead.
It's still in the ship?
Hurt!  How?
The water will still recycle.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Careful, don't get under it!
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
How many?
Hey!  what about the film?
Listen, hadn't somebody better check on Broussard?
It's not going to work.
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Sun will be down in a minute.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Let's let the machine work on him.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
We've got about a week left, right?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Let's hear it.
Turn on navigation lights.
But?
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Let's be democratic.
Right now let's keep it closed.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Yeah... I forgot.
Yeah...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
Thanks.
Match it!
Deal.
Take a look at this.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
That's a fact.
What?
I'm picking up another signal.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Which mean physically going outside.
Appreciate that.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module. That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Only six?
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Tactical nukes, maybe?
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Eddie what?
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
D-day.
Almost four.
Why not?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
You have no right to say such things!
You sat and talked until it was light...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
What do you mean by that?
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
You're being childish.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
You were there? At the play - last night?
Amen.
Of course I knew.
Frankly, I don't remember.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Right here. A minute ago.
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Huh?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
She did...?
Okay.
I thought you were going to be late-
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Here we go...
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
Why you have to go out there.
Also Addison deWitt.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
So am I.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Behind in your dues? How much?
Well?
Night an' day.
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
I might.
Subway.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Well...
I'd like that.
Hollywood.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
But the raves about your performance-
Something most important you can do.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
Harrington.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Roughly ten minutes.
Isn't that what they always say?
Well...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
It's just possible she didn't...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Nothing...
I'm a human being, I've got some!
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Up in the room.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I have no intention of having an accident!
Too bad.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I just played it.
How about me what?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
Answer my question!
I didn't hear you.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--it was fine the way it was--
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
I was sure trying.
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
And?--And?--
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
I never scared anyone before.
Facts or theory?
You voted for him.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
How high up, which Republicans?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Only everything...
--jeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--Teddy Kennedy?
I'm so glad.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
I know where Dwight works.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
Sure--off the record.
And?--
Give me your checkbook then.
It's right under that pile.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
So tell me about the Times article.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
My non-denial denial.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
Yes, sir.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Talk about Segretti--
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
He just did.
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
Thanks coach.
Sorry, coach.
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
...okay...
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Single malt?
Yep.
Seduce her.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Because I want to.
What?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
This isn't any better, Chris.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
You got it, stud.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, enormous.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Okay, well that about covers it.
Yes.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
I know.
After getting laid?
After high school.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
I thought so.
I suppose that would be okay.
Um...okay...
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Not for you.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Yes --
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
It did.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Ready for what?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
Dude, prom sucks.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
AHHHHHHH!
And who's Claude?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
You on drugs? Huh?
Looks like he lied to you too.
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What were you showing her?
Come out! I can do alterations.
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I have my reasons.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
I cursed then all!
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
No. Empress, you --
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
I should go
She does.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
What's your name?
Alvy Singer over here!
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
All right. All right. All right.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Me? Oh, downtown!
I'll getcha a piece.
Nice car.
Huh?
Don't be funny.
Yeah, my grammy.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
it's my first time.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Okay?
Yeah.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
M'hm.
Were you always funny?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
That's sick!
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Yeah.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Step up here!
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Oh, you got a headache!
Bad?
Oswald and ghosts.
You have a raccoon?
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Tell him.
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Just give me the license, please.
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Stop calling me Max.
Right, Max. California, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
I don't know, I mean, I-
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
And... uh-
She was stealing.
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Yeah.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
There were many men interested in you?
A long time.
To code?
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Would it make a difference?
No, what?
The movie.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Of course.
Why didn't you bring him?
Didn't I say?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Why would she care?
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Oh, very jealous.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Lucy overdosed.
And you know our friends, how?
We live next door.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Oh yeah...
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
We'll be fine.
Just do what I say, alright?
I'm ready.
We're great.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
Truce?
He'll find his way back.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Don't push me away.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
You're not ready.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Will you make love with me?
Sure.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Yes, she is.
It's a novel.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I did.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Don't be silly.
Joking.
And I you.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
Scout's honor.
I will treasure this.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
No, never.
Really??
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Are you asking me to marry you?
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
What does that mean?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
And here they are!
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Oh Soph...
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
Not nice.  Not kind.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Hlllllllp!
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
There's something going on, Z --
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Duty calls!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
So...you two are in love?
Oh, of course --
ARREST HIM!
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
Alright, let's move out!
Why are we so successful?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.  How much?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Care to make a small wager?
Sure.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Oh, I understand.
Eight-thirty.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I forgive you.
You shouldn't.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Much better.
Why?
I think so.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
And where are you now?
In his apartment.
What's your friend's name?
What's her first name?
Miss. 
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Cut.
Sure.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
Oh.
I know so. He's a taker.
A what?
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Over a girl?
Where?
Here.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
No -- just come as you are.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
How do you work it with the key?
Oh?  Oh!
You too, sir.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
I dig.
So what's it going to be?
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
You?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Yeah.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
How many pills were in that bottle?
What's her address?  Where does she live?
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
My shoes.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
That's enough, Fran.
I wasn't trying.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Yeah --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Let's talk about you.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
A long time.
I don't believe you --
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Let's go.
Where ?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
While you were sleeping.
Ours.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
They must have seen the fire.
This gentleman or myself ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Do you know that jungle?
Your daughter.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
You want'a surf, soldier?
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
What's the furthest you been in?
No. Walked.
I met him.
Hairy ?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
I love it.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I think think a lie stinks.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
And shut up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Needs patching.
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
107  CONTINUED:
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
157  CONTINUED:
Six months.
How did she..?
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
That's right.  You're not.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
How many do you see?
Don't bet on it.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Get the fuck out of here.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
They'll have to come right past us.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Since forever.
His home number.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Carol the waitress?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
You take off when you have to.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Welcome.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
And?
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Cute.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
I'll take care of myself --
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Do it.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Oh, my gosh.
Now we'll both call him.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Because...  ... you love her?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Picking on me won't help.
Absolutely not.
I forgot to lock the door.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What restaurant?
No.  No I'm not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Probably.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Oh, yeah.
What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Do you want Rath or not?
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
So this is something between you and him?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
The exotic women.
Why?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Because I want to know.
No.  Just the first one.
Several.
Where is it?
I don't know.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Transmits and receives.
Fine.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
That means you won't have a gun.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
For Nicholai?
Yes.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he want?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Both.
Electra --
Anytime.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
Yeah.
No.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Like Custer huh?
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
It's big, right Jahn?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Don't we have enough already?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Destroy the evidence huh.
Nope.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
Why don't we go together?
I fell in love.
What happened to Katka?
It just happened.
They ain't the only ones.
Siberia.
Good, what's his number?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Some deal you did there!
No!
Doug?
So am I.
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Sure. Excellent.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
So, we won't be going to London?
Let's have a look anyway.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
There's nothing there for me.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Good, great....Dobchay!
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Deal!
What is bail?
Well she sure isn't normal.
Am I invited?
We_re not all running away
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
No!
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Can we talk in your office?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Very well.
With you.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
About a job.
No. I won't be long.
I could take after Dad, too.
I need to whizz.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I'm just wondering --
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
-- Your act only works with an audience.
My act?!
You want to tell me...
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Don't you?
You don't believe in anything?
And that would ruin your reputation how?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
You.
Where?
Loved?
What about your father?
I'm not applying to college.
What are you going to -- ?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
Are you?
Uh, yes, sir...
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Uh, hi....
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Yeah. Maybe so.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
How are you?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
Marty. Marty Lewis.
Pro! Release the rope!
Then where the hell is he?
Why?
Sure, he agreed quickly.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
Jesus!
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
What did you do to yours?
Gone?... Where?
What's going on?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
Yeah.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What'd you come out here for?
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Yeah.
Cause I can't allow it.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Positive?
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Not me. No way.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
What? How do you know that?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Everybody okay up here?
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
A what?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
I didn't drop 'em.
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this  believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I  I'm sorry - listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Stop it, Bill!
I  I've got respect for  for working guys, like you 
A week, eight, nine days 
I...
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well... actually, no Bill...
I need help, Audrey.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
A souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
...Barton, is everything okay?
That's all right, really, thank you.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
You gotta believe me 
Hold on 
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Mr. Lipnik.
Yes sir, they 
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
Yeah.
Nine days  Tuesday 
Well, some of his throat was there.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
I thought you quit.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Did you go home with him?
Yes, you do.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
There's a name from the past.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
Yes.
No.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
Did you miss me?
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
Did you ever tie him up?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
I feel fine!
Why not?
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
We bring her in for questioning.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
I don't know.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Ten bucks apiece.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Yeah, I met her already.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I don't like beer.
Who?
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
How about right now?
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I'm here.
Yup.
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
Who said that?
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Yeah.
Still not here.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
You're back.
How is he?
Me? Why?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Wanna Mac?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I need this?
Uh-oh!
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
I'm -- sorry, I --
...four, five.
Things change.
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Yes and no...
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
All is shrill, all is blight...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
What is it?
What seems to be the problem?
Coming on line now, sir.
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Alfred's happy here.
I'm afraid to ask.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Definitely.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
People come first, Dr. Isley.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
But he's never said a word-
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
How about dangerous curves?
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
She has an excellent mind.
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Mystery.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Not much.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Here. Get a good seat.
Take me. Let the boy go.
WHICH CAR?
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
I've considered that possibility.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
David, I'm serious!
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Annie, it's me.
Uh ... yes ...
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Er ... pray tell me why?
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Well, there is that ...
Okay.....
Nope.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Yeah, we should party.
Me first! Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
Huh huh huh.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
That's better. Yes?
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Who knows?
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
We're rich in what really matters.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Then it should be here.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
Well, we didn't know --
We need help.  We deserve help.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Step... mother.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
No, dummy.  Two.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Otho'll know what to do.
Delia hates it.
I'm lonely.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Maybe Charles does.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Oh, really?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
There's no need for a hospital.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Of course.
Hello, Eve.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
You're looking much better today, Ben.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
No, Ben.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
I like to watch.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Thank you.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
... In the garden?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Sid, it's useless!
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Hello, Sophie.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
It's not that, I just...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
So...? Where the hell is it?
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
... Well?
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
John Makel...
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
May 11th.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Just an idea I had.
I was worried.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
A better friend.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I know.
Simulates?
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Thank you, sir.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
Emily Dickinson.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
My tits?
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Ha ha ha!
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Hush, sweetheart.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
A scary dream?
Good morning, Lotte!
Says me. Do you dream often?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
When?
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Who's calling?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I'd love to see your work.
Sleepy suddenly.
Well what?
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Aw, Baby.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
No. I mean work work.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Won't you be late for work?
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Mama?
I know Denver.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
You?
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
No use thinking these things now.
She was only-
Who is she? Where she come from?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Huh.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Show me what you got.  Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Lebowski on the right?
He's handicapped, huh?
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Different mothers, huh?
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I'm unemployed.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
What's your drink, Dude?
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Oh yeah?
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Uh-huh.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you--
MARK IT ZERO!
No, you're not wrong--
Am I wrong!
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Huh?
It's your roll--
It's your roll.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
What about the toe?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Shit yeah!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Yeah.
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
This is a league game, Smokey!
Wanna hear something more impressive? My first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you <i>could</i> take me.
He's half yours, partner.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
What do you really think?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Not alone.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Two so far.
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Take him.
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
What happens then?
But, he could've --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Graffiti --
Like what?
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
For them. But for me --
I was in the neighborhood.
You don't have to be.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
LaMagra --
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
Yes.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--I'm not staying here!
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
I want to see the tapes.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I can't.
--no, what's wrong with you?
You have to go.
Something. Someone.
Fine.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
--fuckin' A right--
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Shut-up.
Yeah?
No fucking.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
--now there.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
By day? No sweat.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
--shit!!!
What?
What'd you say?
I'm sorry.
Shoot.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the woods--
Does she, goddamnit??
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
Abby...
Your husband.
What?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I better get off now.
I said you're bad.
Yeah.
All right...
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
What do you mean...
Nah, I trust ya.
Has Ray come in yet?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Right. Sorry.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
The criminals are winning.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Who knows you have these?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
THEN WHAT?
No way.
What do you want?
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
What do you want?
You look beautiful to me.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
My secret lover.
Yes.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Yeah. but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Just some fatherly advice.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Okay.
No.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Well. Okay.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Um-hmm.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
The coca is my responsibility!
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
And I only deal with you?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
I need you to go to Miami.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
This is not the time, Diego.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Oh, I see.
Mom.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
It's beautiful.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
That's where you belong...
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
I don't think so.
But this is...
Out.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Yeah.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
I swear.  On my life.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Which "district" do you belong to?
Here?
I think it'll be a success ...
Yes, I think so too ... It's been organized well ... But what will the French do?
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
That's the best part.  She gets it all -- everything.
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
What was the nature of the argument?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
I have.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Why did you come by?
No -- but I can get it for you.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
She didn't.  She just left.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No.
Oriental medicine.
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Then -- those are not your own words?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
--and that he changed his will?
Yes.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
No further questions.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
We're not animals.
I thought the subject was sex?
Sure.  Where to?
I know.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Yes -- she did.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It's okay.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You can see me now.
No -- you're not.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Shoot him.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Yes.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Oh Jesus.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Lawyer here?
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
I'll get right on it.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
Oh.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Yeah.
No, your kids.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Yes. Very clean.
Much.
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Do you miss it?
You want to go back in?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Yes.
Have you ever been to that station?
No. I couldn't.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Long day. Go to sleep.
No.
Yes, thanks.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
What about your husband?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
I can't sleep.
What's her name?
Betty.
They're not going to find her!
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Go for it.
Damned if I know.
That's some terrible shit.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Then fuck it!!!
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
Mother!  No.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't find you.
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
You was just doing your job.
Yeah, you heard of him?
Should I?
But the place burned to the ground.
Evidence of what?
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Open the case!
What are you talking about?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
What the fuck is going on?
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Why?
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
All right, Caesar.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Caesar, this is crazy.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
You need the money just like we do.
But everybody is all right.
Yes, I understand.
I should have let him kill you.
You know he would have done you, too.
Where is it?
What?  They ain't there?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
How do I know you are cops?
...  thank you.
Yeah.
Oh, really.
Thanks.
Sure.
How did you meet him?
He's a launderer?
I'm glad you did.
Nothing.
Shit, here we go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
You mean Shelly?
I think so, too.
I think ...
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Any bodyguards?
If he does ...
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
...  Me neither.
What do you want to do?
...they won't let you go...
MPG Capital.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?

Yes.  Is he there?
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Who?  Who came?
Yes.
I need a ride out of here.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I can't believe I slept.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
I didn't know this would happen.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- forget it --
Who paid the bill?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
You could do that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
That's the only angle.
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
I don't remember Zurich.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
... have a look.
... ere please.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Too late? That's for me to say.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Long time no see!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
What is it?
Enough though, eh?
Er ... no.
You're the only person I can trust.
They weren't at school with us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Ah.
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
A heavy Christmas present.
Suit me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Well, no system is.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Let go! We've got to stop!
Are you still following me?
Your face ... are you hurt?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
What a BITCH!
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Can I forget it?
I never signed the form.
What?
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
How long will she he away?
Mistake?
I ... uh ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Numero, trois.
Not ... as such ...
What?
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. Wait here.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No, no, that's impossible.
No underwear?
Just take it easy.
No!
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
At least he's got people around him.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Thanks.
I'll drink to that.
Greatest job in the world.
A medical miracle.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Who with?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Frank!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
What?
You know what. The radio.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Oh, stop it.
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Oh, God, no!
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
Which would you prefer?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Did you shoot their boots?
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Yes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Your hair's a little funny.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
You didn't say anything to her?
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
We could...
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
I see the change in you -- I see it.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
They fired me.
Honey?...
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I don't know.
It's not.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Yeah.
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Right back to you.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
N-no...
You're breaking my concentration!
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Me too.
Carla...
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Better!
Just about anything, Walter.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Leonard, what are you doing?
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Don't ask.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
I know, man.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
What is it, your laundry?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Got carried away, huh?
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
You didn't mean to what?
Yeah, why?
Never mind...
Uh, hi.
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Well I'm overjoyed.
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
OK Mrs. Swicker.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
What's with you?
Amazing!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Mmmnkay.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Well, stay here tonight.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Get away from me!
Please.  It's so '91.
I'm looking for you, actually.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
China.
Lothos.
She --
Skip it.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Uh... gym.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
As for example, what?
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
You are much more.
Could be.
Got that.
Good.
Well, I hope so.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Right!
I am.
You can learn to like it.
My right nostril?
Switch nostrils?
It's all the same thing.
You can't seduce me.
I did.
Aren't we all?
I want you desperately!
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Annie, I think you should leave.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
No.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
It was a cocksucking call!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
You been in the Majors?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
You're a great catcher.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
It's a miracle.
That's right.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Philip, if you would rise.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
Lester...
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Well...
Mommy.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
They payin'?
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
Four aces, Doc.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Okay.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Nope, there's no way.
...very difficult to get in.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
I lost control?
Please...
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
She was afraid to call you.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Nice to see you, Senator.
Right away. Okay?
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
But mostly...
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
It's chinchilla.
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
You can't make me stop caring...
Okay.
Okay, okay.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I threw it away.
Oh...
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Not gonna let me in?
Oh, you are...
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
But it was just mine.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
All right, I will, I will.
Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
No.
Is this yours? Your pen?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
You can't talk to me like...
He won't...
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
And I mean... that's no good.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
Bye.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Exactly.
I did what you told me to.
Everything went to his head. 
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
I told you I was hot tonight.
What's the matter?
Get lost?
Yes.
Come on! 
You do?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
He called you right here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Get up.
This peter's a motherfucker.
But he never talked.
So are we.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
Hey.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Oh, sorry -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
Yeah.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I don't know. I can't remember.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
We'll hunt him down together...
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
It may be time to get the police involved...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Well. I stand corrected.
Why am I still troubled...
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
You've seen me...
You can't get away with..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
Uh. "Thanks?"
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Trust me, you won't have to.
Where do you think you're going?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I didn't hurt you.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Not this minute.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Will you let me explain!
My name is --
Where'd they take you to?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
26th off Wilshire.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Sometimes I paint.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
What bank?
The City National on San Vincente.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Do you know what's in that box?
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Your husband?
You're all three of you in that van?
Put the man back on.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
They put their hands all over me.
A typical fuck-up.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Ask them.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Naturally.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
308-9962.
We don't see you.
Just relax.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Five minutes.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
From here on, I dish it out.
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
What would you call it?
An excellent quality.
Stop it, Dil --
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Did I?
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Who?
What's it to you?
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Don't know. Who is she?
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Why?
Like what?
Whiskey.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
Shouldn't I go?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Give it over, Dil --
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Ask to meet me again.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Okay.
Why, honey --
Yes.
You promise?
Yes.
What?
Died...
Did you hear me?
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
Let me go, Dil
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Tell me what she wore.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Don't call me that --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
You know her, Jimmy?
Need to go across the water.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
He's hot.
No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
I sincerely hope so.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
What?
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
He's at home.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
How is it a farce?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Shouldn't take it personally.
Tree.
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
Oh, yeah.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
What?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Got to catch me first --
What?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
And you know what?
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Relax -- you're gaining.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Yes, you told me.
Can you remember anything at all?
With whom? Where?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Then who did? You're the only one left.
You lied to me so many times --
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
No thanks.
Very sweet.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Were you followed?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
But you're -- divorced?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Okay -- up there.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Or you --  Or you --
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'm sorry.
Hm?
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
The shower's in there.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
But his mother --
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
Swiss.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
And this? And this?
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Why, do you think we're going to?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Is your husband with you?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Good night.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
The American Embassy.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
As fucking if.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
No.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
You never went, uh, all the way?
You are upset.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Are you sure?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
She's still a virgin.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
You gave me a 'D'.
I really do. For your own safety.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
Why?
Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Follow me.
Yes!
Yeah.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
What?
I love you.
Yes?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Kenny's aunt?
His mother's side.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
They're tasty.
Hide your laptop here.
ROD!

...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Where's Sam?
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
Oh.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
You stole this truck! That's...
Doesn't work.
...-cho and a hijack-...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
All right, you got it.
 Okay.
...wanna give it a try!

All right, you got it, you got it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
What the fuck was that?!
 Okay.  That didn't work.

Ho, ho...
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

Yeah, he's a dangerous...
Oh, shit.

Oh, no!
 All right.  Hey.
So you took his...
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...split.
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.

 Okay.


Arlo!
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 

Go!
Okay.  Okay.
Forty-five seven!
It's working.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go.
Look out.

...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who put the big hurt on...
I think so too.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...

...within five minutes.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Three seconds.  One...

Hey!
So...where's my truck?
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
We do need your truck.
...here.   Mason... 
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
Thank you.


Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-bility.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...I wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Grateful?
...always done, Richard?
Went away? 
Good to see you again, Leo.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.

Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Prep the launcher now.
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
Right.  Tim Mason.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...gear?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
I assume you have one.
...the river.
...-tainer!
...and unharmed, de-...
No.


I would've in another life.
They took that life away and left me with nothing.
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
Go.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
Here's what I want you to do.
Uh-huh.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Tie a fly...
...and that power...
...without caution...
Doctor.
Let me have those.
Yeah, yeah...
Where are you now...
God!  They're gonna seal it.
Do you recognize this young man?
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
Now raise 'em!
...on the other end of this phone.
Just go check the temperature.
You sure?
All right, go.


...-damn phone.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
It doesn't hurt.
Tell me. What do the police say?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
What for?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yeah.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
When was the last time?
My daughter.
Avocado groves?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
Ain't worth thinking about.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
No thanks.
Where's that?
I'll just tell my wife.
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
Or her name?
I heard it was an accident.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Yeah.
Gittes, stay outta this.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A private investigator?
What?
What do you mean?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
I can't tell you.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Oh.
Why?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
What about it?
He owns it. You know?
The police?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
She's my sister.
How about a plane?
Where can we go?
He didn't wear bifocals.
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
The obituary column?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I'm sorry, I --
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Hope so. He's working for us.
I don't understand.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Never.
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
I'm afraid so.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Since lunch.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
He owned it.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
What about?
Yeah.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Too bad!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
But...who...
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
OK...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Where is he?
What does it say there?
Oh!
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
You don't really think so?
Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Who else you been to see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
September the ninth?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
I'm sure that's it. 
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
No.
Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
Thanks.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
I didn't say.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
At night?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Susan, I really think -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Thanks.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
I mean I've got a job for you.
I'd like that.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I've got to think of Emily -
Go ahead.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
Sure.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
Yes, sir.
What do you mean?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
Sure. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
God, isn't he great?
There's no light back there.
Why aren't there any lights?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Dante. You've got a customer.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
You saw it?
So you're really getting married?
But you were.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
He's your fianc.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Just me.
I'll assess all I want!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
Wait.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
What's a jizz-mopper?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
No, I'm serious.
How? When?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She meant nothing to you!
How'd he die?
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
He made it, hunhh?
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
You're lying.
Because I'm happy.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I'm not.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
Hey, what about Veronica?
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Shut the fuck up!
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
As if it's that easy.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
Got one. Just pulled up.
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
How do you know that?
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
So.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
I said go ahead.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You're kidding.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
You're trusting.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Oh, you think so?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Where?
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Why do you say that?
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
How many?
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
A few?
Goodbye, Dante.
What is it?
Thank you for the lasagne.
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
I don't want Caitlin...
Randal...?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
Can I have your name please?
I didn't do that!
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
No, I wasn't.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Screw you!
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
I'll see you there.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Dental School.
I will. Take it easy.
Surprise me.
Bags?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
The clip's not gonna hold!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
From one professional to another, of course.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
You mean the nerve.
You got to go back now!
For the same reason you did, to help.
Of course I do.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Cute.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Helluva time for vanity!
Do it, goddammit!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
What about it?
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
You bastards... bastards.
I've been cured.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Won't you join me, sir?
Phoned some friends, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
What would you like to know, sir?
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Keeping fit then?
Well, how are you then?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
No, brother. What d'you want?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Murder, sir.
No, sir.
Lice?
Yes, sir.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
I was quite enjoying that.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
Indeed.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
You got a deal.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Travel...and things.
Bottega.
Dozen times a day.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Pick me up in five minutes.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
Who the hell is this?
Maaaaaax!
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
With what?
Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
How about the thingy next to it?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
How can you kill him like that?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Lenny, my dispatcher.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
Jazz.  Music.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
Leave me alone.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
What, no insurance?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Why?
You had to kill Heller?!
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
None of your business.
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Not for years.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Switch the charts.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I noticed.
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Is this your dad?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
They're big details, Jerry.
Okay, I will.
What?
Thanks.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Come on.
He gave it to me.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Because he believed me.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Well, I don't know if --
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Excuse me?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Only on the football field.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
And what did I say?
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
-- Understood.
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
What?
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
Good luck, David.
No primer.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Many others.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
That's what they all say.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Greenbank?
Like it.  Almost there.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Yes.  Very much.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
In other words.
Something like that.
It's getting late...
How do you mean?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
But --
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Buck is a deal.
I got two years.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
She's got him! You hear that?
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
Pair'a nines.
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Cool Hand Luke.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Take it easy, Drag.
Luke. Where you goin?
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
That fool. That damn fool.
Oh mah baby Luke.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Get out!  All of you!
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
What pattern was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
They get fan letters...
Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Just get out of your vehicle...
Michael Johnson.
Because it's your job, that's all.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Classy madonna.
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
We could use a little help.
Or the F.B.I.?
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
What!? They brought the car here?
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Yes.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
Where are you?
I want to see my mother immediately.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
Really?
What about the engagement party?
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
You're slowing.
Yeah?
Green spot.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
By color.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
A small price.
A rose is a rose.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I have a terrible confession.
Do you?
And did you go to the mission?
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
I'll see you tonight.
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
Always the drugs.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Yes, I suppose so.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
He's a patient here.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Oh.
What?
I think I've heard this speech before.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
A pass.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
Oui.
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Yes.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
I guess we're going to find out.
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Where are you from?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
Has to be.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Don't bullshit me.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
-- Did you set it up?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hard to say.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Go where?   The police are outside.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
You can use my car.
We've got to get out of here.
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Watch this.
Glenmorangie.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
We don't know that for sure.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
It's not your fault.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I didn't have the heart.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
You know about Lo?
Give it back!
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Good.  And how are you?
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
So what will you do now?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
I don't know...
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
No onions?
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
It's just the dope, don't worry
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I have to go.
I think he's yours, now.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Take the dope, too.
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
Another jolly nickname?
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
"Our" Crow...?
Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
Annette Harrison.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Forever.
Got a boyfriend back home?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You talking to me?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
No thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Without question.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Okay?
Of Human Bondage.
You're not gonna start that again.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Lighten up.
No?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Get off me.
It was perfect.
Hi.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Any ideas who it could be?
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Doctor King is my favorite.
Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
That's great.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Does your mother know?
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
No.
He'll love it.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I do.
No. This is going to be our last session.
I told you to lock the door.
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
What?
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Okay.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Nothing.
With who?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
It was... Fantastic.
Mock, mock, mock.
I want to fuck.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Is that what you think?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
It's the least I can do.
She's not here.
Annette! Annette!
I did?
You're a lucky guy.
She really loves me.
I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
The Farren house
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
What?
I suppose so.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
You do that, Edward.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Where did you mail them?
Can't you tell me later?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
But we don't have any sea weed.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
Why hasn't he got a head?
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Yes...yes, that's true.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Good night...Barbara...
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
No.
At Victoria's Secret.
Oh, on my wrist.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
How have you been feeling?
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Mom!
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
So don't look in his eyes.
People notice you Frida.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Why would they exaggerate?
No. I don't think so.
And then?
Give him the tampon test.
What the hell is the tampon test?
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
Okay. I guess so.
I still thought it was a purse.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
Hide him.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
They say sex is great for cramps.
So pee? Here?
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
I'm working on it...
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
So pay them back and apologize.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Coffee and...
A little.
Very well then. Is that all?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
Take some allergy medicine.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
You're some catch Lloyd.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What makes her think that?
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
No one available.
You are mistaken.
I'm afraid so.
A hunch.  He might be able to...
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What?  Who has?
You seem restless.
Shut up!
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
That's what people keep telling me.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
No...
I'm... not... nobody...
I can't believe he'd do this.
I was a senator, you know.
And...
Fine.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Are you out of your mind?
Three years.
I don't think so.
I'm going to kill him.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Sort of... Yeah.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Jesus...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
This is undeclared income.
I'm not sure.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
So what do we do?
Well -- take care.
I'm afraid so.
What?
Dave...
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
What?
Oh... Thanks.
The Fidelity nonsense...
I just fired Bob Alexander.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
What?
I can't say.
Oh.
No.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Thanks.
I know.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
What is it if it ain't a curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
Datura.
Maybe.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
No, sir.
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I don't think they're in school.
Women swoon!
Hey, this is great.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
This is it.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I'm sorry.  I, we
I'm not?
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
It's Nuwanda.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
You know,
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Knox, you're crazy.
Are you going with Chet?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
I was just looking in an old annual and...
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
What is it?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I don't want to read.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
I'll come to the performance.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
I don't know.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
How soon can we get up and running?
Then you better start swimming.
That's where my boat's moored.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
It ain't any better out there!
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
How do you know that?
You're saying they can think?
Yeah...
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
And what if I run into one of those things?
You ain't giving the orders here!
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...
I'm stuck...
A little to the left...
Nowhere...
Someone's back there.
Shut up!
She fucked me.
Who's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
It won't open.
Yeah.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
No.
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
Worse since she talked to him.
Kind of. You didn't know?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda, Linda...!
Will you marry me?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
There's Vince!
You got it.
Hunt with Vince?
What are you, God?
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
What do you mean?
No way. No fucking way!
No. No way!
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Right.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
I gotta get back, Nick.
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
Merle gave me this?
Yeah!
What's it for??
Never one.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Put that on your political resume.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
Give it to me.
I'll be alright.
And I want Doucet.
What are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Yes.
Good night, Wade.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
You want to be a good detective?
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
...Have you been drinking?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Hi.
The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
He lied to me again.
And what about Daniel Webster?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
What Grange?
Belle --
-- in gold.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
He was --
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
You really think so?
You want me to go around --
Well -- yes --
Coming.
You're right, Mary.
Yep.
Who is it?
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Thanks, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
I'm serious.
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Do you really think that?
I say -- it don't matter.
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
I won't forget.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
Why don't you?
It's okay, it's okay.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
And if he alters it...?						*
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Only if New Jersey counts.
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Come on, what's under this?
What about the kids?
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
How are you doing?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
You're crazy.
That's it.
You're really crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
You don't have a choice?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
They were ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Okay ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Come on, lemme load you up...
It's all we got.
What now, Sonny?
No you don't.
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
Howard!
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
You stopped?  Why?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
How'd that happen?
But do you mean it?
Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
I have to see.
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Doing what?
Robbing a bank.
You could give up.
<i>He killed two children.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
I can certainly think of one more!
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
There are no bond certificates.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
Not really.
Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
She went up to her room.
I don't like anything else.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
No, you the man.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
You're welcome.
Is it a good morning?
We're still standing.
I'm in here.
Yo, I'm gone.
See ya around.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I'll do.
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
Fuck!  My money!
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
What is?
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Talk to your son.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Do we now?
OK.  OK.
That's it?
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Later for you.
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
I didn't know you could read.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Sez who?
Sez me.
I like Mookie a lot.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.
I'll tell you why!
Depends how you define 'new'...
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
No, I'm fine thanks.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Me too!
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
HARRY! Here he comes.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
You're always your harshest critic.
Yes.
Go away, assface.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
Hello, he only invented money!
You certainly did.
I lugged it all over town!
But I ate your Mom's pie.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Roger that, Wilco.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
What?
Try one in a million!
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
What are you talking about?
Go in there and get us two slushees.
You know I do!
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I think you'll make a good teacher.
And...?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Love it!
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
Is he....?
I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
Why do they come?
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Stop him, Jessica!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Thank you.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Dracula?
Ah!  This is very exciting.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
That's great.  Let's do a take.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
This is the big moment...!
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
I guessed.
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
What?
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I'm going to my mother's.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
That's not true --
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Would that work?
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
I like to think so.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Okey-dokey.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
Isn't he dead?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
Maybe it needs special handling.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Bela died.
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
Let's get married.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
LOOK AT HIS SKULL!
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Mr. Wood!
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Isn't that the same thing?
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Okay, I'm nuts.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Yeah?!
Good luck.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
What?
So he killed himself.
Are the TV people with you?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! And that girl has a name.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Could've been a nurse?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
She left.
What are you talking about?
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Our what?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Right.
Yeah.
Go!
I missed you.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
That's lucky.
I know, I ...
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
I'm sorry.
What?
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
It's nice.
What do we have to do?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Yeah?!
Marcia's living with a singer?
Ray --
Oh, Jesus.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
It's me, Ed.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Cassie...
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
What?... Why?
We have to stop meeting like this.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Anything wrong?
What?
Dick... Dick,..
So nice
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
I think we've got a problem.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Why are you lecturing me?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Would you sign it for me?
You'll be fine.
Door was open.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
More this way.
Should we get a what?
points at the motel.
Right now?
Three twenty-five.
What do you mean?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
If you say so.
I'm not like you.
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Yeah.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What'd I do?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Dudley, what do you want?
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
<u>What do you want</u>?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
I got to write my report first.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Look at a picture for me.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
What about him?
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
Of course...
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
But you were business associates?
No.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Okay.  I'll do it.
What?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Really?  What did White say?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Do you have any proof?
Officer White?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
Where'd you hear that?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Yeah.  Me neither.
Working whores with squad two.
I'm telling you, I--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Do it!
That's who they are.
Wait.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What do you mean?
None of your business.
Jesus.
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
Yeah.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
What about newspapers and magazines?
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
Not particularly, no.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
What are you saying?
I'll be right back.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Why?
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
I'm not his attorney.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Right.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
It wasn't me.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
When do I get to meet him?
Brill.
Never.
Yes.
Other than me.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
You're wrong.
I have to go lingerie shopping.
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Fuck off.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
Mr. Dean--
What are you talking--
She's in the kitchen.
Yeah.
No "900" numbers.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Rachel's dead?
Bobby--
They're framing me.
I don't know. I mean--
You're tired.
So do I!
Bobby--
I need help.
I honestly don't know.
What the hell does it mean?
What about the tapes?
Get it.
He's clever. He had help.
You're kidding me.
So they know everything.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Excuse me.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I'd like you to have them.
Look over there.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Don't.
It's a folk song.
Shall we be all right?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Oh dear.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Her hands and feet were tied.
In my room.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
No.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Very true!
What did you say?
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Yes.  Dropping off.
I can already see.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Your friend?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Hana, I know you do!
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
I mean home.  India.
Then come with me.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
This is making me incredibly angry.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
How close?
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'm in the middle.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I have a proposal for you.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Oh?
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Possibly.
Can you follow simple directions?
I never carry...baggage.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Yes you did.
A dozen times.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
I'd taken the Mask?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Feeling old?
Surgically attached.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
It was wrong to deceive you.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
You gave them the eight billion.
In the van.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
You are a miracle worker.
Because it pays off.
We're supposed to.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Call it an expression of trust.
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
That's a joke, right?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
They did?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Excuse me?
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Don't bother.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Course I did.
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
And you can't?
Erin --
That's crazy -- why not?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
They skipped that step.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
So why would PG&E offer it?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
How do you know that?
I wasn't gonna --
Yesterday.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And ...?
You're married.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Thanks for reminding me.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
I didn't say that.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
That is not what I'm --
What's that?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Ben ... Ben ...
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Right.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks his agreement.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
We're in trouble!
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Does Luke know?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I'm against that.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Can you trust him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
... just remember that, cause I'll be back ...
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I'll bet.
Hyperdrive.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
I'm sorry too.
Luke?  I don't get it.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Are the coordinates set?
Oh my, no!
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But tell me why ...
Only what you take with you.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Never.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I don't believe it.
Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
He's a gorilla.
Humans?
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Yes...
He's... near.
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Which way?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
The freeway.
Who?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
What's this, what's this?!
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Not you, my husband?
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You, my lord.
There is one.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I swear it.
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Hiding?
Fuck it.
No, she was heavily sedated.
We still don't know.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Please.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Of course. Have you got a pen?
Really? wow.
Rats?
That's good.
Yes, I think so.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Please go away.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Yes am.
Sure did.
He didn't mention?
That depends.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Oh............
When can I have one?
I found it.
You know how?
No you don't. I do it all the time.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
St. Mike's.
So what's next?
You just missed them.
Good bye.
In here. With us.
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
Save your servant
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Amen
The Lord be with you.
She'll go into coma.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
I don't know.
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
Take it now.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Baker.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
It was an accident.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
So do I.
This time you gotta go.
You gotta go.
Her hands.  Like that.
Frank?
We don't get a gig.
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
What?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I don't know what you mean.
Hey, you weren't there.  Right?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Okay?
It's early.
It's not gonna hurt you.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
So what do you think?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
No. Why?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
The party's over.
February?
A useless talent.
Seventy-one
So what'd you think?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
My watch is broken, too.
Don't take it personally.
So run a little longer.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
It's orange!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Give me that.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Is that important?
Uh, well ...
Born and bred.
Will I see you again?
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
His kid's sick.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
What's that supposed to mean?
How do you know?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
What happened to the donut king?
I guess it's getting serious.
Why not?
Fine.  You?
You mean if I get sick?
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Something good?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
That's what they always say.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
That's your name, isn't it?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
Gone?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Adelle?
A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...
Sure.
Five thirty.  Okay.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Kates my wife...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Howd you know my name?
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Why not?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Thank you.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
You hear me complaining about that?
Jack...dont even start...
No, shes not.
HEY!
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do what?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Its wonderful...
Its like a museum.
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Youre not married, are you?
Dont get on that plane!
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Last night was great...
Relax, it's casual.
You'd never know it.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Ben did this.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Oh, I think you already have.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Skeptical...?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
How bad off is he?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
With no laser --
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Now I know...
I have no idea.
You can't --it's too dangerous --
No, it requires such absolute precision --
A great deal more than that, I believe...
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
What's that?
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Then why not take it?
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
How are you, Miss Peterson?
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Well, we better get on with it.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Go ahead.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
Unghh... oh, geez...
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Three people. In Brainerd.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Oh, now he's adorable.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah, he -
Where'd you get him that parka?
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Yah.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah.
Uhn.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
Yeah, but -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, I see.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yah, how much money was that?
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
...Yah.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
No kiddin'?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Ah, dammit!
The heck d'ya mean?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Yah.
Yah?
Oh...
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah - how are you doon?
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
I'm sorry.
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
What'd he say?
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Uh-huh.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Oh, fine.
Oh, my.
Congratulations, Jerry.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
In case we want to switch nights.
Marla?
Like testicular cancer?
I wish I could return the favor.
I don't know.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
I've done you enough favors.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here...
Oh, yeah.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
I mean -- for a living.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
And, now it's gone.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
Thank you.
What?
This fight, pussy.
Anyone?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
What?
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Yes, I promise.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
I want to know --
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
... is over.
This isn't possible...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
Green?  Did you say green?
Defuse the bomb?
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
You will.  You know you will.
What have you left for me?
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
What?
Maintenance.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You and your friend.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
May we come in?
No.  What's this about?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
...My Premonition was just like his.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
I know, honey.  I just --
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Who am I, David Blane?
Nice try, kiddo.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Why do you think I was hiding?
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
That's right, buddy.
Ninety.
One hundred.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
I've seen worse places.
No cigarettes.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You comin'?
Crazy motherfucker.
Spooks?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Nguyen is good boy.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Invulnerable.
I know.  I go with you.
It's not necessary.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
I say we tape him to a chair.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
You got it, sir.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Why this is outrageous!...
No, I'm fine... really...
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
My agent.  I called my agent.
No... it's just...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
But..How could that happen?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Uh... basement I think...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
I was nine in the sixties.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
<u>What</u>!?
<u>What</u>?!
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Parry.
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
In a bar called Hellfire.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
What a gyp.
I never say anything I have to.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
That's right, hand.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm going on over there...
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay...
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
No.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
How do you know it's clean?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Who's Van Oost?
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Daddy's very ill.
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I don't think that's accurate...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
Just give me a chance, will you?
No, the last time was three years ago.
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
What?
Of course.
A play-ya.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't!
Wussup, Victor.
Wha'?
C'mon.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
You live around here?
Nah.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
Would you like me to change anything?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Oh, thanks.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
They didn't do anything.
Fletch.
Fletch F. Fletch
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Okay. Some idea.
Thought so. What for?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
I know. I got bad luck or something.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Why not?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
John Ultrarelamensky.
I have this effect on lots of women.
I bet you do.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
John Ultramalensky?
Down boy.
God...
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
That's what I want to know.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
What are you talking about?
I think you better sit down.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Don't tell me I can't --
Lock's busted.
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin...
Practically.
I want something I can print!
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Have what?
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
Yeah, let's bury her.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Wha --
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
Peachy.
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
Ye-ah.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Fine!
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Fuck me...
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
What?
No. 
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Il est en retard.
But will they?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
Strike out, eh?
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Not a chance.
Whip it out.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Suspicion of what?
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
Let yourself in.
Pass.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Baltimore?
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Wish you weren't.
Do you know how much I love you?
So am I.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Frank...
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh.
Get him home safe.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
What'd you just say?
What'd you say your name was?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
No wait, don't go!
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What are we like in...1998?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
What?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Okay, okay...
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Go in where?
Better.
Longbranch...?
What?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Whoa, I just...I just...
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
What?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Cool it, Andy.
Your bed.
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
And, what about us?
Sure, just watch where you're going.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
I could swear I heard...
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Daddy, what is going on?
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Uh...yes.  But...
It's just beginning.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Nancy.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Yes.
Twenty.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
For a good reason.
Sorry.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
You don't know shit!
-- Bad?!
Really?
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Hear what?
Not another word, do you hear me??
Perfectly.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Oh dear God...
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Yes...
What about you?
What do you mean???
Is the ship going to sink??
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
Shut up, Elliot.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
It's just a review.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What about the haircut?
Then you should carry a gun.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
What do you mean?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
This is how we've managed to last.
They'll lose because they're my team.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
I have a class. I'm late.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
First you tell me.
What do we want?
Two-all after six.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Who the hell cares?
I'd forgotten that.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
You're hurting my head.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
I can't find it.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
So what are you going to do about it?
Everybody else does. Why not you?
You're charming the boy.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
This could be it!
Why does it matter?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
Postpone. We have every right.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
You're not making sense.
Sidney.
Yes.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
So do I. Over and over.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
Is what true?
I don't know.
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
Yes.
Never mind.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Eleven.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Well, we shall try.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Hm.  Is it?
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
That was England.
It's split the Government.
Ahh.
Somehow I expected not.
Er, no...
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Grudges?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
Often.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Jerome--?
Six one.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Suit yourself.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
Any particular reason?
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
Is that all?
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
I was never very good at it, remember?
How the hell did you get here.
I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
Antonio, the choir...
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Where?
Does it have a name?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
I get my own help.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Beynon.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
I want to take a walk.
Better than old times.
Really?
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I'll bet you can.
When they find it, they find it.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
Yeah.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Suit yourself.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
'Bout five thousand.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
A Ford... We have a Ford.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
How?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
How'd it happen, then?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Jack...
That's nice.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Do you?
Could you do me a favour?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Especially when I play the lead.
Sure I'm sure.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Expect so.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Working at Woolworths.
Yes.
Where's that?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Yes.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
It's not like that, luv.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
No, you won't.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Uh-huh.
No. Are you tired?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
What you doing around here then?
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Can't say I do.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Scotch, please.
Nasty way to go.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Shut up.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
To get on the...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
They did.
It's too...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
That's right?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
Himself?
What?
You build it!
You fucking build it!  Men come...
What?
Yes...?
Someone should hurt them.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Did you?
You...
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
...and rob the place...
I didn't ask to be.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
You need money?  Is that the...
I do?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
They stole...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
To the cops?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Why don't you think so?
No.
They're inured to it.
Yes.
No.
In school.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me...
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...then...
It isn't me...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Was it?
Abso...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
John: John:...my daughter...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
They...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Kenilworth.
I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
I don't know.
My wife...
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
She won't listen.
What, "this"?
Guess who?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They--excuse me...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Your contract went out to the bank.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I'm not hungry.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
What if we don't pay?
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Not for strangers; for my country.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Let's go.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
That's not the way we look at it.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
She's gone, Tom.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yes.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
And Kay...she's all right?
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah, it was once.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
The baby I lost...
Who's asking?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
However I can help you...
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Very impressive.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
And?
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got no choice.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
It never crossed your mind?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
You do that.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
You did not know?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Nice place.
The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
This David's a friend?
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
No.  I could have, though.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
All righty.  I understand.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
How long were you...?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
David produced her last picture.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
I didn't have the guts for it.
I'm very sorry.
There are straps in back.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Pray you, undo this button.
Have a drink?
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
You only embarrass yourself.
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Elsa?
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
Of course.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Yes ... Kip ...
Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
I knew you'd say that.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
I don't golf...
Kip.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
What are you still doing here, Randall?
Something like that -
You betcha --
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
one minute -- !
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
You, too, Ma...
oh.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Oh, for God's sake
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
We're going shopping -- !
Six or seven...
I understand -
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I think so... They're just... So ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
What's that?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
What happened to Sway?
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Shit all looks the same here --
What?
Nods again.
Liar!
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What bag?
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Shit.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Have a drink first.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You're some fucking jerk.
Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
So do I.
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
We'll pick it up.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
--or a tail--
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Gone.
Why didn't you yoke him?
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Yah, it's not a bad school...
Good.
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Fuck her.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
I'm Irish.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Will you take a check?
That's one aspect of what we do.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
And what do you see?
I'm sorry.
Fuck do you want?
I think so.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Who proved the theorem.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Not at all.
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
Sean...
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got one of those too.
He was my roommate in college.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Watch your mouth.
No, I don't.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
What did I think?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Not to me, they're not.
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I'm Will.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
How was that?
Pretty boring, I guess.
Bullshit.
Do you know all their names?
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
Then let's go have some fun.
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
So, do you play the piano?
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Government.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Have a little snort?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
I don't know.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Got any plants?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Pa! Shh!
Ya say we're acrost?
Didn' you get no sleep?
You promised, Tommy.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Looks like you done it.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Good-by, Tommy.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Ain't no whisky, is they?
But what about this?
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
Wonderful.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
You could've been a contender, huh?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
To make a long story short...
Here is now there. There is here.
Bad experiences.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
You're a government spook?
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
That's probably a good idea.
Will you come with me?
I'll hide.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
I just know.
You know where I live?
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Okay.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Excellent. Here they come.
I don't think so.
--Nooo--
Wait a minute--
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
I've looked at it.
That's wonderful, Mom.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
You're leaving me hanging here...
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
See you in ten years.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
It is cocktail hour yet?
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
A jogger, huh?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
She did?
Feel good?
OK.
How did you find out all that?
What?!
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I don't care.
Fine.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Well, now you know what it feels like.
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Good.
Yes. We're suing.
Exactly...
Hi.
Riding with Judith.
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
She calls him Tommy...
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Oh, how sweet.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't know if I can.
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
I want to watch.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
WAS SO!
Honey... I was always good.
It's cool!
Alright sir.
Hack the Planet!
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
What did we learn in school today?
Blow me.
Thank you!
That's bullshit.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Yeah! Sure.
I said give me time.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah.
And if I win?
How?
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
What? whatwhatwhat?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
You don't owe me anything.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Yes, sir.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I do.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
I don't want to.
Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
It was the nightmare man
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Well try dammit!
I've got you come on, go down.
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Hi Jamie.
You won't come on too strong.
No problem, Sheriff.
Its true, Sheriff.
It isn't a man.
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
What?
Saving the treats for Bob?
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Totally...
Yeah.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Why are they under there?
What about the rest of my comic books?
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I promise.
I saw him...
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Yes.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar.
Mmm.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
It feels like you're in France.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
I can't resist.
I cry at the opera.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
Well, are...are they big?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Oh, Elliot!
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
How-how's Frederick?
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
He's got like six gold records.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
But, you got four children!
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Are you in love with someone else?
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
It's on the table, Dad.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
No, thank you.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
I can't take this anymore.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, yes, you have!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Yes, please.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
That's really nice!
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
...from Mavis, also.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Are we talking about cocaine again?
She really does, though.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Well, how about this?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Easily.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
You want some?
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
How are you?
No, the reason I ask is--
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, wow!
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
When'd you get here?
Tch.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
And?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
...how are things at the Hospital?
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
I'm looking for...
Why me?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...would you excuse me...?
Yeah, so where is he?
First things first.
Why did he come back?
...are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
No.  And...
You give me whatever I want...?
Awright.
I won't take much of his time.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
...here's to child abuse!
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Let the girl go.
Why?
'fraid it's too late.
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
What is that supposed to mean...?
Said what?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
I'll have them picked up.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
My scar is a war-wound.
I have had the honor. 
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...and my need for The Institution...
...but will that satisfy you?
<u>Yes</u>.
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
...not to turn around.
...what?
...and that is what you need to expand.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
Hey, lost again.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
I know it well.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
...would you use a small word?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
No.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Say Hi for me.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Wha-at?  What is it?
This is...this is...a very special moment...
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight, Jasper.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Not now, Wendy.
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Oh shit, yeah.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Yeah. Scary stuff.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You know what I want, babe?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Goddamn Geek!
I guess.
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
May<u>be</u>.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
That's enough, Yvonne!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
That . . .
It's so beautiful!
Yes . . .
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
The way you just looked at me...
All finished.
Eighty third most common.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Really? Do tell.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
How many zeros was your wife worth?
What's that?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Uh... eighty two?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
Where's my wife?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
We're all here for you Trevor.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
I don't work here.
Two.
Wow you are out of it.  
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I got your bail continued.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
How recently?
It's November.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Bill, listen...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
Vietnam!
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
Read it.  It'll be fine.
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
John, I know all about it.
You do?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
I didn't ask him.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
-- hospital.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
I understand that.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
You must value your independence.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Bye, Neil!
Aw, okay.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Did you hear what he said?
There's no card or anything.
He wasn't there.
Oh, honey.
I think it's time I came home now.
This is my house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Do you have enough money?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What did the thermometer say?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Would you?
No joke, Lieutenant.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
We don't have any proof of that.
He had to come from somewhere.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
You sure?
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Most people are afraid of death.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
As friends -- always as friends.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
That doesn't matter.
I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
How?
Your life.
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
I'm leaving in the morning.
You'll no see me again.
Do you love me, Conner?
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
I don't know anymore.
I don't know.
Why?
I know.
Why?
No.
You don't really believe this do you?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
Not unless they're immortal.
How did you know that?
Get out.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
How could they get by him?
What's that next to him?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
I think he's dead!
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
Yes, sir.
Keep trying.
I understand.
It's happening right now.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
You won't die if you let me help.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Not if they're looking at something else.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Give me an ETA.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
I think you got no choice.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your head down.
Where are they?
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Order your men to stand down.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
They've been in there all day.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Who is it?
Leave it to me.
I'll be back.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
Bring back your policemen...
I am on a list! What list?
You will tell them the truth.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
For supplies, you drive.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
Show me your ID
Our cards, please.
What cards?
One thousand francs.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
I will give you my house.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
What about us?
We have been abandoned.
No, no.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
What's wrong?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
How dead?
What! Paul storms off.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
So what stopped her?
-- bullshit --
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
-- I'm sure you did.
Excuse me?
Left, goddamnit!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
I don't think so...
No...not air --
And then where are we?
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
That's crazy!
For chrissake give me a hand!
It's succeeding!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
So where's the party?
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
I know.
-- in the act.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And here's your goddamn severance!
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
The lockdown thing.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
-- ten.
For the love of God....please...?
It might have been her mother.
We don't have proof of that.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Good-bye.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
I'm scared!
Go to your room!  Now!
Why?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Or what she was worth.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Should I...
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
What!
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
That is the story of my life.
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
And he still sits there?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
I'm sorry.
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
No.  Really?
Unh-unh.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
You're apologizing?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
But I said I was sorry....
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Yes way.
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Prison?
Uh....old badminton injury.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Actually he never told us what it was.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
We're here to say, your government was right.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Yes.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
If you think you're getting past me...
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Jerky Circle!
With a little jazz.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Adenoids?
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Muncie!
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me look.
...Huh?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Norville!
As a three-dollar bill.
Forty-eight years...
Martinis are for squares, man.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Get up!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
...It is?
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
I haven't had --
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Damnit, where's my car!
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Ya don't say.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
Hello, Niagara.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Ti-Joseph?
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You don't believe in it?
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Yes -- on the boat.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Of course, Wes.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Of course not!
Good morning.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You didn't drive her mad.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
I do. I'm -- are you...?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
What do you mean?
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
I'll drive you --
The phone's out.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Let me.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Of course.
It's not like we're too busy.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
But not too ashamed.
Ouch.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
See ya.
Shit. You're not planning --
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Great, thanks for the tip.
Sure.  Twinkie?
You like him? He worships you.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Yeah.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
They left it in the jungle.
That's all, for now.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
What's that, then?
Don't worry about him...
Then change it.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What time was that?
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
To do nothing.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Don't do this, Hap...
I'm not expecting anyone.
What did he look like?
What is it?
After that she left the party to go to him.
That's a long time.
Yes.
Your lips, they didn't move.
But you're the fairest by far.
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Why does he call you that?
Yes...
Be still!
Love?
So you felt it too!
Yes...
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
I want a woman.
You have fed. You were made for this...
That and more.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The story about stakes through the heart?
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
We haven't exchanged anything.
No.
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
I've got to see.
You're okay. Thank god.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
This weekend?
Will you try...for me, please?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Hey --
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
How's Julie?
Yes!
No. Yes?
Wanna drink?
How's the water?
And do what with it?
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
Good winds and bad winds!
No one can take my father's place.
I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
I was looking for you.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
The General  you don't even know him.
How do you know what my father thought - -
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
We still don't know that it's the plague 
You are my friend.
If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
I shall not leave the island 
Well, tell, him.
Who?
Merry Christmas.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Our clothes are dry.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Well, naturally. Of course.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Mother . . .
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
I won a flower.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Will you try to get some sleep?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Oh . . .
No, sir.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
I hope it works.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know, but . . .
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
All of it?
Hello?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
You like it? I'll send you a box.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
Neither am I.
Beautiful.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Ummmmm . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
I'm going to scream!
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
George, darling! Where have you been?
You have no idea what happened . . .
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
What?
What?
What the hell.  For you....
I want to go faster!
I think we're changing course a little.
No.
I hope that's the cousin.
They're moving pretty fast.
Shut up.
I was counting on hours.
That's awful.
We'll take your supercargo.
Gangway, Turkies!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
Want to swim home?
No!  It's still there!
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Oh.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Got it.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
The what?
The Shark's mouth.
We don't know that, do we?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Right.
Better yet.
It's good with coffee.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
We're alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Someone has to do something.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Did you say Cable Junction?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Who'd you ask?
Just like this.
What Kids?  Who went out?
Power line.
It'll be fun, come on!
Maybe.
Oh, shit.
So?  So?
Go on, you're tired.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
You buying?
Want another one?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
I guess.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Are you scared?
Yes.
Thank you.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
Yes, you can.
But you --
Nobody told me.
Fine.  Have them do some.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
We're taking that shark alive!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
The one that goes underwater?
What're you doing later?
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Yeah, well I didn't!
No, South Georgia.
South Georgia, Antarctica.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's large enough...
You have a man near it?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Sharks???
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
I want to see Kathryn.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
I wouldn't mind going down with her.
He told me you both did....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Where's my mother?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
You caught me....
Whatever happens next.....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
You make sure they come?
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm fine....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
I don't want to talk about that.
You must get bored easily.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
A big one....
No!
You'll be sorry.
What?
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Just like that?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Get her started....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
I wish there was something I could do....
We'll pass around cigars....
I made them, man....
Forget it....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
'Snuck up on me....'
Screw you, Jake....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
To throw out of the window.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Have you got a print from the hand?
No.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Maybe he's lying to you?
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
He ain't offerin me shit.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
No.
Why not? You heard my voice?
Me?
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
No.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
I was married to her sister ..
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
It's not possible right now.
I'm going back to the institute.
I wanna be near you ...
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Don't mix very well with beer.
Even better.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Well, I'm happy for you.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Sure --
Good idea.  Thank you.
I may not sue.
And I appreciate that impulse.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course I know --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
As opposed to twenty angry women?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Oh my God.
No, I'm saying to be --
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Rod, get on the camel.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I'm a little worried --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
Not a chance.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
What DO you stand for???
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
They do, my brother.
Let's go the zoo.
I'm scared.  What is it?
What'd I say?
This is how you play God.
You hate to swim.
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
We have to help him.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
They're here.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
You think they could talk to each other?
The last of my breed.
Something must've scared them.
No. I couldn't see.
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Stan.
You are an academic.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Okay.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Isn't it obvious?
Good.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
She's nuts.
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
What?
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Oh, no!
I'm trying!
JUMP!
Where's Ian?
Can the kid walk?
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
What now?
The monitors are failing.
Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Dilophosaurus.
Stick to my heels.
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Alan?
Please - - chance it.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
What are we looking for?
Yeah.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
I didn't say you were scared.
What kind of opinions?
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Alright.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Thanks for the presents.
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
I think we're lost.
Help me with this.
Other guy?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
He... he's here...
Who's there?
That's my job.
_Krueger_...
Who?
Who's chest?
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Fascinating.
Add it to the list.
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
-- Small.
Just what you've published.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You're just doing your job.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
No, sir.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I know.
What?
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
I wouldn't put it past him.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Usually.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
They're dead now.  We can get help.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
That's your monkey, Denham.
) They are now.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Uh uh.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Please --
Don't belong?
A few more days. We know who did this.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I said yes, I see.
You said that.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Why?
Could I ask some questions?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How would I remember?
-- OK --
No.
You said you wanted these.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Don't worry.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Yeah.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
That who?
What?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
No.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Yes sir, we know he --
Lunch in a restaurant.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
On earth.
Soon.  Very soon.
Goodbye.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Yeah?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light...
Sure.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
What don't you understand, pal?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
I do not, your honor, however--
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
And what is your present salary?
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Yes.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
What about Billy?
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Yes, what?
I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
Murray.
Right.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
You and Charley?
Please, Thel...
It is alright, Father.
Are you? Of whom?
And you have horses? You love horses.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
I will not approve it.
I have.
Soon.
Did you receive the letter?
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
I miss him too.
We do not know.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
When it is time.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
And, America?
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I leave tomorrow.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
It is a story, you decide.
I would not know. Maybe.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
We have.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
How could I ever leave?
It is a difficult situation.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
You're crawling around like a--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Yup.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
The more he thrashes, the better.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
I never had sex with you!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
I'm just saying last resort.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
You flew up here because your boss--
'Night.
That's probably good.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I didn't say it like that.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Look.
Alright, Jack!
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Good idea.
Hector.
Keep firing!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Let's go.
Obviously I was wrong!
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
You talk to the married couple?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Hector thinks you like him.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Are you on drugs?
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
Thanks, Ardelia.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Oh.
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Thanks.
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
I think so.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
And the questionnaire...?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I don't know. Is it?
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Then tell me how.
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Let's go with it.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Yes, miss.
You knew them.
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
What?
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Fort Edward, then?
Then what?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Fire!!!
Yes sir!
For Munro children?
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
Crunch...Implosion.
Can you fix it?
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
What's wrong with it?
Roger.
How's TransOcean doing?
Timex...
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Twelve hours!
What are you going to do to him?
Sixpack...
DeJesus...It's got him.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
I'm not touching you!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
It's hit us all hard!
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
It's a Samoan pub.
You get the guns?
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Furry muff, let's go.
Er well, yes we do.
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
What do you mean?
Why, what's up?
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
It's pay day, ain't it?
Yes?
And?
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What are you doing, Plank?
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
And that does include the amp?
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
What about all the gear?
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
They're not going to jail.
Who's "they"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
So they stayed in Florida?
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
So you're going into the Army?
You lived in the States for a while?
Lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
You going to get married?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
And people make their choice--
Eladio Cruz.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
We have a murder?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Well, you hire illegals--
Why would I want to go there?
Thank you.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
Well, you were working there--
I'll see what's going on.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
They've got me. Different thing.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Pilar--
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Yeah.
The Republicans?
They got telephones.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Just doing my job.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
And people better clear out of here! Now!
What's up?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
You know who it was?
He's gonna find out.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix?
How?
Why?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
It's an illusion.
Why did you wait so long?
You don't?
I don't know where you'd start.
I can be very persuasive.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
That's my business. Harry.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
Stuff?
What then?
Are you sure?
It's okay.
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
I left three messages already.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
If he was so good why's he so dead?
Then what do you want?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
What's the difference?
Are you sure?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
What about?
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Have you been in?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Yes?
I don't know.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Yes.
Oh.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
No, its easy.
I don't remember.
Oh.
You are.
Working.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Ok, bye.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Oh, come on.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
When are you coming home?
Ok.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Good...I'm tired.
Sure.
I gotta go to work.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Are you sure you have to go?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
I believe in you.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
We're still going to be together.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Father, I'm right here.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
What's that got to do with you?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Yes.
What's the...OH SHIT!
No oxygen to the brain.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
Watch your mouth.
That's not it.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
He's fine.
Really?  Well, come on, then.
This time get your feet set.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Oh, sorry.
Huh?
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Get used to it, babe.
No.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Yeah, right.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Chances are there's still a chance.
I'll take that as a compliment.
But?
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
I don't care.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
So that means I have to ride with you.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Guess not.
None of your business.
Plan to.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
We're going to get some food.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
We won the championship.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Kiss my ass.
Figured it was something like that.
Something was just missing.
From basketball.
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
And what happens when you lose?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Hey.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
I have.
Keep your voice down.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
We still have to go?
We were just studying.
Sorry.  You okay?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Lucky kid.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
ooohhhhhh no.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
What's wrong?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Sure is.  So why call me?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
baby, please, please --
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
No.
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
ok.
I don't have a boyfriend.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
What's that stand for?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
...yeah...
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
It's fine.
Yeah.
I'm sorry --
Say what you want and you'll see --
I want a shot of tequila too.
It doesn't matter.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
Son, please, now....
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Sorry, little man.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
What happend?
Is it real love?
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces?
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Who?
No.
You got us a room so quick?
Like I said, yeah --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
And that's what you've heard?
She's my mother.
I wouldn'tve asked --
In five years?
Where does that name come from?
And "Frank?"
Is Linda here?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Is he in pain?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
There's no disturbance.
I preffer to stand.
No.
Been drinkin' today?
Did your wife find out?
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Fuck no.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Did you tell her?
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Yeah.
I don't.
You should know better.
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Are you on drugs right now?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
What are you doing?
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
818-753-0088.
Mmm.Hmmm.
mmm.hmm.
Ok.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
..sorry...
Hi.
....Why does he do it...?
Nothing... Nothing.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
I am with you!
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
But -- but --
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
What you're asking is impossible!
What use am I?
Come on...
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Whose rooms are those?
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
It shall be done, your Majesty.
... Two-thirty-seven.
Sire, I --
You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
A letter.  May I see?
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Great. Well that changes a lot...
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
And who are you?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
And what did he do to the girl?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Up north.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
No...I'm in some trouble...
OK...where do you want to start?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I don't recommend it.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Library of Congress.
You look all right now.
These are all dead, Will.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
What is it?
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Get me a plane...
No.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
He went to the men's room.
Let me stick this in the black hole.
It's a surprise.
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
I'm fine.
You'll come by?
I don't want to know.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Not me.
Are you a man?
God, no.
Absolutely,
Dr. Chilton.
Yeah. It's right here.
Why do you think I called?
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
I remember.
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
You got a deal...
What's that?
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I figured I'd ask you...
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Pray tell.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I don't have one right now.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Why does it feel good?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
You got it.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
I refuse.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
You've got good days and bad days.
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Andy!
Oh!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
I'm here, ain't I?
I can shtop whenever I want...
Oh, it's open.
Have you told your family?
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Then your father's a wimp.
And you're just poor white trash!
Each show is worse than the next.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Bob Gorsky.
It's my name.
Know what?
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
Right...
Hear what?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
An accident?!
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Who's coming for me?
How?!
What does that mean?
This can't be...
Be what?  Be real?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Show me.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Yes I do.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
What vase?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Is it?
What happened?  What did you see?
We can't leave him!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
Zion?
It's a city?
How?
Because I believe in something.
Duck!
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
I don't know.  I lost him.
Sounds good.
You sure?
Why?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
So?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I could have told you that.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Mind your own business.
What pipes?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
OK.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
We'll settle it tonight.
$20.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
We'll be here.
Oh...around...why?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
Don't ask.
No.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
But...
Yeah, I think so.
You mean it's heisted.
Quiet please.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
But what?
Red or white?
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Of whom?
Then why did you bring it up?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
In my sleep.
Did you just hear something?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
You have a way with words.
Olympic.
Is there any more to it?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Uh -- he's from out of town --
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Certainly.  Goodnight.
I don't think so.  Do you?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
You get not to go to jail.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Some spot you pick.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
As long as it takes.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
I'm lost.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
I don't know.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Will it?
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
'Love will find out the way'.
'Love will find out the way'?
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
Thank you.
You've got a deal.
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
That's what everybody says.
Yes.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
You tell me, Bill.
Um -- not right now.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Not at all.
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
Say again?
I think you heard me, Bill.
Then what is it?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Which is what?
So that's what love is?
He is --
And we're very grateful.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
An indictable offense.
'...Yes --'
You fill the bill, Bill.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
It just occurred to me --
What?
I'm sorry, I --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I'm here.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
What the hell are you talking about?
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
The 'question' --
Yeah, I give a shit.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Joe?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
That's why it's okay.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I would.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
Condition?
As requested.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.

You did explain, Lenny.

* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You know it?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Why?
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
I have money.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
How do you know him?
You can't just take it!
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Doing...?
Grieve elsewhere.
"And" what?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Good.
You can't.
I got to talk to my ADO...
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Maybe I'm only one.
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Is this the protective male talk?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Nothing.
Good.  So let's go...
Verdado where?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Never heard of him.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Alonzo...!
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
I had to lay eyes on you.
Alonzo...
Lotta rich women back there...
You sure are a pretty lady.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
I ain't sleepy.
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Two kilos.
Twenty months?
Billy?
About ten kilometers.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
How much did you figure to make?
Be tough on 'em.
About as good as it looks.
He wasn't even in the car?
What do you mean?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Yeah.
Yeah!
Two thirty.
Yeah? Where?
Max - where?
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
The kid's with them!!
Go!! Just go!!
Hurry, the woman needs help!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Please.
No, there's...
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
Fuck! It broke the skin...
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
How long...?
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
What's it about?
Oh, like I could do that?
It has no nobility.
I know how that can be.
I DIDN'T...
Perfect.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Yes.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The what?
A toast?
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
You've been out of your room.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
He's your client, huh?
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Maybe you can, Libby.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
Answer me a couple things?
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
On what.
Well, that's good, isn't?
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
What are you talking about?
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
..or hard wired..
What are you talking about?
I am. She is.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Oh, either way works for me.
- this is very disconerting..
Indeed.
That's because I'm on my back.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Affirmative.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
No.
No.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
No...
You gotta be kidding.
And then what?
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Yes, I gathered as much.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
Yep.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
By asking me.
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
So what do you suggest?
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Always.
Krieger.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Sure...
You don't think we're going to make it.
What about you?
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Go secure.
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Why was there another team?
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
Information.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
My contact is extremely shy.
Jack.
Just don't chew it.
Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
Jim we cant.
No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I guess.
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
- and picked us up in the States -
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
I remember..
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
And get a doctor.
Good luck.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
And a lonely ass.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
You haven't said anything.
You look tired.
What's your news?
What are you doing here?
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
He's in Palermo.
Let me come and talk to you.
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
No.
Just Johnny.
I'm telling you your life!
I was dead, too.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Get all of me. Take everything.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I've never seen a moon like that.
You don't get along with anybody!
I'm in love with you!
What?
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
You're late!
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
Never is a long time.
Will you marry me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
What do you mean?
Sure.
I have no secrets from my family.
No.
Pop don't like Johnny.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Your hair's different.
Are you drunk?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
But absolutely!
I am alone in the world.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Nerves.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Sure.
Good night.
Sure.
It's a house.
Cosmo.
You were a tiger last night.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
King of the WHO?
Well, how did you become king, then?
NI!
Of course.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
So be it!
Had enough?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
My liege ... forgive me ...
OF course, my Liege ...
... You silly sod.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
To find the Holy Grail.
Right.  Off you go.
What is your quest?
I can't take him.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
What - the curtains?
Father, lad.
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Listen, Alice ...
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
No.  Until I come and get him.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
What?
Yes ...  make sure ...
Sir Galahad!!
You've come to rescue me?
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Sixty.
She loved him.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll get over it.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You know nothing about her!
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
A situation?
Quite.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
That's not good enough.
Dare say you can be taught.
If you hunt, you kill.
I'm fine.
This is the top.
Maybe, once.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
The greasy pole.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
I'm glad of it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Ah, well...
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes, ma'am.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
We'll see which way the wind blows.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Yes.
The same, your Majesty.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Why?
Again?
I have no idea.
From whom?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
What is the matter with him?
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
What's her problem?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
I'm in the middle of it...
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's already out.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Yes...
You have no time.
Of course I am.
Not yet, honey...
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
You're broke!
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
There is no problem.
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Whatever.
How's that?
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I told ya.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Call the number.
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
I'm all right.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
No... but...
No.
But I want to.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Betty Elms.
Go ahead.
Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
The one of 'em still alive?
Find out who they are?
Palmdale.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'm working on it.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I'm not listening.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Okay.
Great...
The Brooklyn Bridge.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
I work here, remember ?
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
A dragon.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Ow...
Thanks...
Got it.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
He already had a balance of $600,000.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
We will start work on it now sir.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Thank you, sir.
Son, let's watch the tape.
What do you mean sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
He's been expecting you.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Bruce has just awaken.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Excuse me, gentlemen
Wake up, we're in trouble.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Who was that guy anyway ?
No.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Don't mention it.
What about living in the real world pal?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Thanks, I needed that.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Special effects?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
I never met my mother.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
What, you think the guy should change his name?
DON'T, come on!!!
In the tar??
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
This is a totally barbaric custom.
And you'd be my cousin?
This has been a real confusing day.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Part adventure...part miracle.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
I'll be here.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Oh no.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
I know, look at his little hands.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
No.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Did she ever see Vada?
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Any more soda left?
What?
She likes to play bingo.
Sorry.
Soon honey, soon.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Really?
Do you miss her?
I'm very nervous.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh come on.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Thirty five dollars.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Please.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Probably.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Yes!!
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Naah, I don't wanna.
It'll bleed.
Uh huh.
Yes.
It's my mother.
What do you think it's like?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Sorry.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
For their meat.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Part of being a New Yorker.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
It's too late to start over.
Manicure...
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Oh, you're more than okay.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
Gold nose hair clippers.
Hello.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
I need you.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
It's more than that.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Oh, yeah.
Lower.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
What?
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Green.
Whose word?
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Your job, huh.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell is he?
He has that sign with the tree.
What!
You know better than that.
Whose?
Not yet.
Your brother?
Hi, Sherry.
Suits me.
Well, he's really amazing.
We don't mess with accessories.
What year?
The car broke down.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
How do you know if they do?
About three years.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Who is this?
That's unkind.
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
I'm not sure...
What?
Yea.
Linnea?
Oh?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hello.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You serious?
Sure thing.
I see.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Who is we?
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
I can appreciate that.
By all means.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
All right, Mickey.
Don't worry about it.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
We'll all be killed.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
You made every day like kindergarten.
And they made the first move?
And a snake-eye glare.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Next week's episode.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
What are we talking about?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
What d'you say, Duff?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Just so you do your work.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
I wouldn't have let you.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I don't think that'll happen.
'Round town.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
She don't look no worse to me.
What did you say, boy?!
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
How often is that?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Okay.
I guess not.
It ain't in me.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Well, I got married to one of them.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Okay, boy, beat it.
She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Of course.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
And how do you suggest I do that?
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
What about McCoy?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
I find out now.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Are you even really alive?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
Right...
What?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
It's coming.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
And Linda...
You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
Maybe something's onto him.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Go ahead...
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Give me five minutes.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
...And if I guess wrong?
No we don't...
What is it?
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Thanks.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Okay. That's bad.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Geller, this is way out of your league.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
My sword.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Little known fact.
Sure, why?
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Well, are you here with anybody?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
What are you doing here?
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
It's happening again.
Ah, nothing.
Wow...
Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
What is it?
You want to talk about it?
There's nothing to figure out.
No.  I'm okay.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I had such an awful dream.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Do you still...see each other?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
I think so.
So?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Those are ancient history.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
Fuck off.
Why is that?
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Didn't get much sleep.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
For what?
The truth.
Remember -- open mind.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
Where...here?
Well... a shot at it.
No thanks.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Oh right.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Busy tomorrow?
I was.
Yes, you did.
No, you were brilliant
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Well done you.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Yup.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
What?
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
Can I have your autograph?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Do you want to stay?
Yes, I think that one may be.
What?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Me?
Yes.  What do you think?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
It was good.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
I'll see what I can do.
Right.
Well, fire away.
Can I help you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Point taken.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Good luck.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Why not?
Right.
Yes.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
What book?
Yes, that is correct.
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
I-I-I...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
No! No! No!
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
I wanna report a robbery!
What for?
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Yes, ma'am?
Thank you, ma'am.
I hope everything is settled.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Go ahead! Go back!
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
What? Where?
What for?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
So why are you talking to him?
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
Sure, Mack...
What's he talkin' about?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me. Hit me!
Bye-bye.
Yeah, it's cold!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Poker!
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
You bet, Doc!
Time out!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Oh, yeah?
Ten bucks.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
What?
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Yes, ma'am...
What's that?
Is he one of the loonies?
Your grandmother?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Your great aunt.
Except possibly that.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
He's safe.
What?
Because I don't have the right name?!
I'd really rather not say.
Mickey Spillane?
Oh.  That's nice.
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
I know the feeling.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
What would you call it?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
And more...
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
No.
Is he gay?
Why don't you ask him?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Oh.  Right.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Oh my God.  Where?
A little bad luck?
It was a ouija board, remember?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
No one's perfect, Kate.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And Larry?...
Oh.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
Mania.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
Then don't.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
I better see you get there.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
The things that go on.
Want to go out and have one with me?
It's quite  nice.
Go ahead, wear it.
Terry, what's wrong?
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Terry, for God's sake.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Every one of 'em... .
Farm...
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I think you could have.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Gimme.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Be careful!
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
A symbol, Master.
What kind of symbol?
The moon is almost gone!
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then cancel my order.
For what!?!
Is there time?
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Yes.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
I know a Glenn.
No, thanks.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
His assistant.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
At least.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
What'd you talk about?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
It was an unusual experience.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yeah, why?
Wait.  You not Adele?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
I don't smoke.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Nervous?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
I thought so, too.
Of course I am.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
You'd probably tell me.
Yes.
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Well, does it make sense to you?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
I called your room from downstairs.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
You think he's lying?
In the trunk?
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Must be a real soft pillow.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
I know what you're talking about.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
Islamic.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
You not with probation, one of those?
The State Theater?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
My little girl, the tough babe.
I told you, he isn't here.
When's he due back?
I don't have any idea.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Still...
Ten gees.
Red...Strange?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Sir, I --
You guys are new?
Power dive!
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Then why are you looking for her?
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
I can't make it.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Don't get smart with me, son.
Well sure, Colonel --
Bombers.
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
All of 'em.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
It's that jerk Walter.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
I call this the staccato. 
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Save it.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What am I going to do with you?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
How'd you know about that?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
I know.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
What would that be, sir?
Have a nice day.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
But I'm remembering the future.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
I don't know.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
When do we start?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm going out, Dad!
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I'm not burying him here...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Maybe it takes a while...
Go later...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Drew!
We're not skipping this treatment.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
What's that mean?!
Ready for what, baby?
Honesty is always best.
Don't do this, Andy.
We're waiting...
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Do you... pray?
I still am.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Yes.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
In some situations.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Yes.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Get real.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
It satisfied me.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
What kind of people?
Second.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Who?
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Yeah... ?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
How did you do that?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Helloooo...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
What, you're afraid?
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Probably right.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Like what?
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
I never said I was.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
Some prophet guy?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
The child heard you before any of us could even....
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
So much for my cocktail hour.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
And they fell out of the sky with you?
It's probably wrong --
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
That way.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Do as I say.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Then you admit --
Of course.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Do you believe him?
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
What?
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
That's a nice way of putting it.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
...there's nobody.
Sounds like it.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't know.
How careful should I be?
I see.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
No thank you.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Is this the best you can do?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
So have I.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
And Betty Mayfield--
You leave it.
Wonder what?
If you're doing all this just for me.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
That's right.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
Is it a crime?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
Morning. Any calls?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
A thousand.
Got the information on you?
You, Killaine?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Yes, I've seen it before.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
We do, when we get the chance.
Well--good night.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
It could have been an accident.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
I don't think you locked your door.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Go live in a tent.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Such as?
You can find out.
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Well.  What about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
Positive?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
How about Magruder?
That leaves two strangers.
But you still think she's innocent.
Who's the girl?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
What does it look like?
Right.
I say YES!
It's kind of you to see me.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Yes.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
And I didn't like that man.
Well, you know...
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
And the Argies.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Let me see.
You're a piece of shit
Suez.  1956.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Now listen...
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Okay!
I'm not FBI anymore.
Not so far.
What?
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Thanks, buddy.
Okay, Dad.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
You sure?!
Shrimp and fries.
Meaning you were expendable.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
You never did know when to quit.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
No more games.
We're not going.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
It's been a long time, General.
They never are, dear.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
No.
What?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
The price just went up to ten.
You're not from L.A., huh?
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
I never joke about money.
Edward... you got it!
Exactly.
Do you plan everything?
And why do you say that?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Just a romantic, that's you.
"Occupational hazard".
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
No.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
What if someone tries to steal it?
The opera.
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I've never treated you like a whore.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Yes...
I'm up.
I bet.  That was our rent!
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
Why'd he want you?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Rent.  You're late.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
But what if they serve soup?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
You mock my pain!
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
But how can you be sure?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
What? -- go on --
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
What?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
And a good thing too.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
I thought I was going faster.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yeah?
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
What?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Sire.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
There we cannot help you.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Hah?
Sixty-five.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I smell nothing.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
An hour.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
What are you saying?
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon,
"Keep a shining in...
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'll wait in the hall ...
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
What do you mean?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
With whom?
No kidding?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Yes.  We would!
All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Very nice girl.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Of Siegfried...
The Graf Spee...
The Blue Max...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
We can't... we keep our money there!
Send for Goebbels.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Of which morning?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
She isn't still here, is she?
Not at all!
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
My mother.
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Who are you, friend?
Casharoonie!
Sam, if she's here...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Five hundred.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Lila.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Arbogast said...
Why can't I go out there with you?
Without calling me?
Huh?
I believe it.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam!
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
How can you even think a thing like that!
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
You should... mind it.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
Very early. Dawn.
Crane.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Is anything wrong?
Frankly, yes.
Norman took a wife?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Maybe you want my money, too.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
I'd love to.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Meaning what?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
You give me a pain!
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Now don't that call for an extra!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
No kiddin'.
Old Howard Winton's cub?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Horsefeathers!
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Cry-baby?
That's what I said.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Dad...
What universe are you in, Paul?
How?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
But I'm curious, Rose.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
Well, some fiend might.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Am I hurting you?
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
What are you going to do, Rose?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I can't see, let me see...
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Yeah, they're in the snow.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
Honey, please...
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, it has buttons.
You don't know where you're going?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, sir.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, sir.
You mean a farm?
I don't believe it.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Now you know what to watch for...
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
What... ?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
We should slow down.
Stop blaming yourself.
I got him.
Yeah.
Name one.
What day is it?
Same day as before.  I think.
You don't smoke.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
It's not gonna happen.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You're lying...
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There probably is.
There'll be other chances.
Maybe.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
No you're not.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Yeah.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Yes, my Master.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
I gotta get you out of here.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Ahhh...
Lower it!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
Let's see.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
I told you, my car broke down.
Janet.
Yes.
Oh Brad.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Oh...
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
It's just a..a party Janet.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
You know this earth - this person.
A decision had to be made.
I didn't make him for you
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Makes you cry
"Transylvania"
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
No no no no.
Creature of the night.
...Fine.
...I'm sorry.
Shell-shocked!
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Do you have a phone?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
I don't think I belong here.
Do me another favor?
Yes.
It did.
-- The legs.
...I can't beat him.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Get outta my life both of ya's.
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
...Of the truck that run over your face.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Few minutes?
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
That's it? -- Completely?
That's it.
...Fine.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
A few bucks.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Sparrin'?
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...What?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
Whatta you get outta this?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Don't get mental, man.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
It's all yours.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
That's right, me.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
Maybe.  Why?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
You tricked me, damn you!
Yeah, that's better.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Young Romeo is it?
He shall be endured
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Farewell.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Here's goodly gear!
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
This is important.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Is that right?
That's right.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
Just business.
I'm a patriate.
There's a problem...
There's been a slight problem.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
But you hate each other!
There is one other thing...
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
And you respect him.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Soon.
But first you have something to take care of?
It's been known to happen.
Who's they?
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Coordinate what?
Things.  This is my country, you know.
Something like that...
What's the difference?
One's a lot more painful than the other.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
There is that.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Gregor's cell phone...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
How could you have done that?
So I do it.
Finish it!
What of it?
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
You put everything on the line because you...
You slept with the fucker!!
I get the picture.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Seven thousand...
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Never heard of it.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
What are you thinking?
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Well what are we supposed to do?
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
And you're solid on that?
Rock solid.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Two thousand...
Because someone may have gotten away.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Thanks for your time.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Why would someone do that?
Anything...specific?
Well I don't know...
No, I can't say that I have.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Why?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Then what the hell are you all about?
Well you're not getting, either.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Yeah.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
So someone did get away.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
How much is that?
I don't think so.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
I don't think so...
That's right.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
This won't take long.
Who died?
Who?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
No.  She's a school teacher.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Gimme the binoculars.
What is it?
No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
Get it out of here!
Take it!
She saved our lives.
Fine with me.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
See you in the next world.
Yes.  We have heaven.
How was the sex?
No mu-shu.
Steamed dumplings?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
What is Mac out?
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
First class.
Amen to that, brother.
I need your help.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Baby Duck?
I'll take him.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
This is still Hong Kong.
That's some serious poundage in dollars.
I know, but --
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
We are both full of shit.
What?
I know a shortcut.
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yeah, it's good.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
No...what?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Carter, shut up!
Shut up!
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
What are you talking about?
Yes.
Yes.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
I'm not running.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What did he ask?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
We'll rub.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I already made an appointment for later today.
No.  No, you didn't.
Or a vegetarian?
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Thanks.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
You're going to be very disappointed.
We think so.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Agreed.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Missed me bad, huh?
Lost!
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me, either.
I love you, too.
So, we'll...
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I'm listening.
She's the boss.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
But I'm weird.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Not this one.  This one's on me.
A harmless joke.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's delicious, trust me.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
What?
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What's with you?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I should say something in this about magic.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
What?
I love you, too.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I want my money.
Come on, Jonah --
What?
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Magic.  It was magic.
Mom!
You don't believe in signs.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why me? What about Jay?
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
I don't know --
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
What is it?
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
Right.
Stressed.
Go to sleep.
There she is.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
That's true.  Why is that?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Get out.
No.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Do you like it?
What do you mean?
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Yeah.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
What's more important than sanitation?
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Backward.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Will you be still?
What are you saying?
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
You mean Delaware?
No. New York.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
What attitude?
I was talking to my wife.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
That's long enough to get out of town.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Like you?
It's the only way to play.
I just can't. Okay?
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I don't want to leave you.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Sorry.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
10%.  That's ...
He doesn't have one.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust anybody.
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Big Bill.
Big Bill
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
It's not my place.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.  What about him?
And what does this have to do with me?
He's the only one I told.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Maybe he isn't showing.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
Sir?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
The Army gave you that?
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Shut up, will you?
Like hell, you did.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
A half-track, anything.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
I heard.
Same place we are.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Hell of a mission.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Good news?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
How about I go right, sir?
And what about your own hand?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Yeah, how so?
I'm listening, sir.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
But we accomplish the mission.
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
What if our guys open up, sir?
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
I coach the baseball team, too.
I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Excellent.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I hope you understand.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
He's a mess!
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
That's just so embarrassing.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
I dream about it.
Alright.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Crash paranoia.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Just finishing up in here.
Honey, about what?
No, but you stole from them.
That's right, work it out.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I'm so ashamed dad.
You will?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Twisted?
Job?  Being a great date.
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Come on.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
This is so noble.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Yeah you do.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Oh shit.
Okay.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
I know.
She's very successful.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Your car?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Now you're back.
Sir, the list is correct.
What -
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
What's going on?
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
When?
It's good business.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
How do you do?
Pistols?
So I'll talk to him about it.
No, no, what, what is it?
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
We're aware of that.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
I heard a noise.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
I'm losing you.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
Good for you.
She dumped me.
You freakin?
I think it's out of your control.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Or it found us.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Tails.
I see you read the book.
Billy had alibis too.
We'd break some furniture.
Don't worry...
Dewey, there's no such place.
Humor me, Sid.
I'm everywhere.
Her old boyfriend?
Thanks, Joel.
..harmonica style is okay.
But she's standing right next to you.
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Catch him, or kill him.
What Rielly?
What?  When?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Go there.
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Yes, sir.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
You don't still think it was me?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Who is this?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Just some scary movie.
Uh-huh.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
What kind of lead?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Should I be worried?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
Forget it.
Do you still think he's innocent?
And why would she do that?
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Hello Sidney.
Who are you?
No you didn't.
...out at the airport...
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
So what's his reason?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
What happened?
Whatever. Just hurry.
Bye.
He was there, Tatum.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Oh, god...
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
What am I? The beer wench?
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Give it to me.
How's that?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
Ease back, Mills.
No, I haven't heard.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
I read about it in the paper.
It's not too far away now.
David... please...
NO!
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
What the fuck is going on?
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Just wait!
No.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Call an ambulance.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
And so what?
You got to be kidding.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I don't see anything.
It surprises me.  It really does.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
It was, I tell you!
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
In that case, give the boys room...
By what you preach...none!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Yes, sir.
If they're still alive...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
That don't make 'em kin...
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
You crazy?
Where?
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Do you have a better idea?
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Does this dog here belong to you?
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Ask him.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Romeo
Ned is wrong for it.
Done.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Cut his nose off.
There's never any
by order of the Master of the Revels!
it will be all right, madam.
God be praised!  Locked?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
No, then.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
I did not.
Go on.
How goes it, Will?
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Good title.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
Stand up straight, girl.
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
But the plague
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
Who is there?
It is strange to me, too.
It was the owl--come to bed
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
The Queen has consented?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Wait there.
No, sir.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
And her voice? Like lark song?
What of her bosom?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
A man, my lord?
I was trying to educate you.
In the same fashion as chess.
I don't have time.
I'm only asking what you think.
Have you seen him?
He couldn't get his car started.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
So who's going to do it?
Take his legs.
Is this necessary?
Just stop worrying.
After.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
They know.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Well, yes.
Cameron?
Yes.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
Yes.
All right. No problem.
Did what?
Don't.
No.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Are you all right?
You know we're right.
Forget it.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
You're frightened.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
That's what I thought he said.
You mustn't take it so badly.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
You mean I can have the room?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Yes, absolutely.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
No one.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
Here.
Exactly what I was --
And that's not the same thing?
That sounds fine.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
The first one was fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
I mean, that's what it's like.
Or a fake?
Chicken salad.
I don't know, I think...
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Who?
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
No.
I don't know.
I don't want to talk about it...
What?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
Yes.
No, I know.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
She what?
You know what I'm talking about.
Like what?
Are you in love with her?
Are you?
I guess so.
No thanks.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not like my mother!
Wonderful woman.
Great.
I guess not...
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
No, I'm sure.
Whew.
Do you? You still see him?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
You did, I know you did.
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
What about it?
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
Fuckin' A --
I am you, you little bastard.
-- mmm --
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Lester's on his way.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
-- how did you get here?
That's too bad.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
How did it go at the bank?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
About what?
Right now?
Where's your car?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
I'd like you to leave now.
Baby, don't do this --
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
They're not?
Oh yeah.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
... this doing hair it's...
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
Oh, hey...
All night.
What do they look like?...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
I'll have to wash one out.
What about Jackie?
I mean, how did that happen?
Lester, it just happened.
I'm finished with her.
No.
Somebody's mother.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Fine.
I'll call you.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
I guess not.
It must be something.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
How much?
Well, there was this one time --
But why Egypt?
Is he an enemy?
Let's do that.
Of course not.
-- just wonderful.
Three weeks.
John...
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Dad?
Are you sure?
No.
Tony.
Do they know he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Danny, come here!
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well how can I repay you?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
Grady... oh.
All right, sir.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
I did?
Thank you for saying so.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
And you didn't see anything at all?
I think he did it to himself.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Yes...
Jack...
Wendy!
Wendy...
Great...
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Hi.
How do you do?
Eight thirty.
Uncle Al-
Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Let me help you up.
For getting a divorce?
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I think I hear it!
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
What did who say?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
Yes?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Oh-huh.
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Because we're
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Um, I don't really know this one...
What?
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Babies
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Three years.  Sister.
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Really?
You watch yourself!
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Your name?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
And all those like you.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Come, Sister.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
I am?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
What?
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
I am?
I've been worried about you.
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
What?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
Not... totally.
Yeah...
Which one!
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
He's kind.
It's better than ice cream.
She's our inspiration!
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
What are you spying on?
A fine idea.
Well... that might be... helpful.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
If you want.  But...
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
What are you on about?
To avenge his father, and the others.
What did you say?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Use caution.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
She did not do it... please listen...
She has confessed.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Yeah.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
Leave.
It went real good.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
You told me to come by.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
If you want me to.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
It was still alive when you buried it?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
I know he does.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
You better go get 'em.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I never was no good with history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Right now?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
We sure like havin' you.
What brings you back?
What's that you say?
So, you're really going to stay here?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Karl is a guy guy?
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Before they were married?
That's really strange. What does it mean?
I didn't mean that.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Will he be supervised?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
That's the subject of my last chapter.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What's the difference?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
A photographer ...
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You what?
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
No, bully for you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What is this, some kind of joke?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
And?
It'll cost you five bucks.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Not a one.
Say hi to Paul.
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
Well, if you put it that way...
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
Is your father an artist?
Drawing's a good thing.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Appreciation for what?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
The inspiration.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Here, catch.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
None.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Objection!
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
I should show them an American?
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
Carl never lied.
I can't speak for him.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Wanna see my driver's license?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Bull fiddle.
Funny?  In what way?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
You don't see any blood?
As far away as possible.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Fight it.
Good night, Josephine.
How can we?  We're broke.
But this is so humiliating.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
You can both go take a flying jump.
WHAT?
Jerry - there's another problem.
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
I'm Sugar Cane.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
Interesting.
I'm a very sick girl.
Half-full.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Daphne.
I hope so.
I thought you said three years.
What's the big idea?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
We could dye our hair.
You're not sure?
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
I'll throw up!
We can have it altered.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
William Morris!
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Then why did you take this job?
Have you ever been with a male band?
Rough?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You are?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
My fault.
I wish you'd make sure.
Not very likely.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Up, up, up.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Bon voyage.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Completely.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Oh, no!
Is it that hopeless?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
What is it?
So inhale!
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Let's make it an even million.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
You shave with your spats on?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
Pub Golf?
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
If Ed ever found out....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
Its cute.
What is?
What do you think?
What?
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Hi.
Thank you.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Of course, dont be silly.
Its complicated, Dad.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
That does it...
I try...
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
She was dirty and wet...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
NO! N-O, NO!
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Yes, ma'am...?
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
You sure can, son...
No mam -- I looked all over.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Might be...
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
There are more important matters right now...
The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Fragile?
About what?
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Hey, Chef.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Baba mama!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Do as I say, Kyle!
That's gonna take a long time!
Our moms suck!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
What about air strikes?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Yes?
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Hello, Brooke Shields!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
You did? Just now?
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Hi Stan.
Cool!
And the butfor?
Anna...
Very professional of you.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
My...wings...
It's a little late for you to be up.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
What is the condition of the bridge?
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Great.
Simulated space walking.
I understand.
What do you think's going to happen to us?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
No...
Why?  Where are you going?
I can't!
I'm about to blow the wall.
What do you mean?  What happened!
Marry you?
Where's Taylor?
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Right, I understand that...
A bowler.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
- canker sore.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Theo's bowled on the tour.
Seven years.
Need some advice, huh.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
She's my mom.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
What's it look like to you?
I gotta survive.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
It depends.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
You shouldn't touch her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
I don't want to play.
Junior.
SHEILA!
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You still got the touch Junior.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Line up where you want it.
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
What does he do?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
You're here.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
He's my father.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
We would have sooner or later.
Are you sure he's dead?
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Lips still for sale?
I'm looking for somebody.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Back away then.
I said back away.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
What was that?
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
What team?
Storm?  What storm?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
A thousand feet.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Hold on --
Maybe older --
Just worry about yourself.
I think I do.
Wait a second --
What am I -- a dog, now?
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
They've left, keep watching!
Then how can it be chipped?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
What?
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
What is it?
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
Internal power.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
Too big?
Resetting the sub.
Because when we get down there --
It never occurred to me.
What -- are you threatening me?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
My gosh, Norman.
Wait a minute.
Beth --
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You did, didn't you?
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
In case you die, too?
Still clear.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
What?
Tarazine?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Three to six hours.
I'll just boost the doses.
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
I'm feeling better.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Don't you?
Did you?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Beth --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
It's either this... or I kill you.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Hear what?
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
I never said that.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Another attack?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
What do you mean?  She's not here?
I'm trying.  There.
No idea.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Meaning?
Arrived?  From where?
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
Does this mean what I think it means?
No, they didn't say --
This way, sir.
Captain who?
Really?
You mean they haven't told you yet?
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Try this one.
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
I don't know.
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
I'm not afraid of anything...
I'm not going out there.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
Not any more!
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
It's automatic.
Why?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
I think I did.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
With four casualties?!
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
Death to all bugs !
I didn't see him !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Others are waiting.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Oh, I see... teamwork.
You're upset, that's alright.
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
You two have so much in common.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Yes, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
No thanks, Diz.
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Flip six, three hole.
What's that, Diz ?
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
AAAAAAAAAAA !
No, sir.
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Not a problem.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
What is your position ?
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir !
You may proceede.
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
I'm aware of that, sir.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I want him here.  Sit down!
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Mr. Decker... ?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Why aren't you on board?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
To you, sir?
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
It's about life.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Yes.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Mmm.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
<u>Yes</u>...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Uh huh.
What are you doing down there?
You got a paperclip?
Oh.
Why?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Because I'd met someone else.
Why?
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
No, that's true.
What?
Yeah, you?
Now you're talking...
Well ain't you amazing.
I saw...
Water or mineral deposits.
We had a date.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
He works on the movie.
I'm sorry.
We'll work it out...
They know what her tits look like.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
And I need a drink.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
That Could Be.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
It's...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
I've always seen that.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Mr. Barrenger.
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Izzat so?
I wasn't in the car.
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Look, look there's someone else...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
Bob are you alright...?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Why?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Doug, this is Mr...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
He didn't have to tell...
Later for you, pal.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I don't drink.
Where have you been...?
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
We don't have the money.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
And we're glad to have you here...
...not at all...
...it is?
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
It happens.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Great.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
Not with my mouth open.
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
I'm not.
Yes.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
That's so weak.
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Not use my words, please!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
Ice cold water.
There you are!
Annabelle put down that camera.
No.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Rachel's job is she works.
How do you know?
Oh.
I helped.
You dying.
And when did that pass?
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Easy enough.
Good...Well...Take care.
Don't do this.
What did you do?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
I did it for her.
Fine, forget it.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
See, I know that.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
And you said...
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Are we.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
It's no biggie.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Restless.
Because you've changed so much.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Don't ever say that.
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey. What's up?
Thanks, Scoob.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
I'm still poor.
You have a bay?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
No, you don't.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Is everything OK?
You mean, again?
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Take off your top.
Say, Ni...
'Fuck me hard!'
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Great!
But...you called.
Oh, that's too bad.
That's too bad.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Great. How old are they?
No, I don't think so...
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
So where'd you get in?
But what did you get on your SATs?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Y-yes--
Listen man, I don't need this shit--
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Even better.
Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
I don't want any...
I insist...
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Good.
Drop the anchor!
We can't--it's power driven!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
There's enough in one vial...
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
See!  See, I told you.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Didn't they tell you?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
I see.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
That's close enough, Major.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Have you tried the recall again?
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
I don't think so.
What?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
They can't touch us at this height.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Let me check.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Sure, King.
Yeah.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Yeah.
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah.
That's the rock star thing.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Jesus Christ.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
In the limo!!!
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, no.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Buff is funny. God.
I can come visit?
I will.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
I just started it.
Hey, thanks, man.
I could.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
He is.
A Porsche.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Military marching bands.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Erica.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Pony and I are friends.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Oh fuck.
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
No.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Yes.
It's a piece.
So you can give me more shit?
About things that are important to me.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Can I talk?
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
What feelings?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
You do.
No, I don't.
Jeff!
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
For a ride.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Oh, fuck it, man!
'Bye, Jeff.
No, it's not...
Yeah.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
So how's college?
Yeah.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, this has everything to do with you.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
It's stupid.
Oh!
You do not!
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
So where are you?
The fuck not?
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Wayne Gretzky.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
You damn well better...
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I hear she was a terror to work with.
That was the general idea.
Come on.
Why, you sweet kid.
As for instance?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
He thinks it could be made into something.
What about all those ideas you had?
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
It's just impossible.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
What were you -- a child actress?
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
No.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Get out!
You're a writer, you said.
I will not have it butchered.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
I don't care.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
What's wrong with It?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Who?
I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
When did he say it, Norma?
Where are my cigarettes?
Thank you, darling.
Good night.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
No, they don't.
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
No?
Yes, Madame.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
No, a super girl.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you mean we?
It's for your own protection.
You love me?
You're not afraid are you?
But why?
I'll mention it upstairs.
You vicious--
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
George---I thought you'd never ask.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
The scoop of the year!
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
You're not...an orphan are you?
She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
It was just a trim.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
No, MR. Danvers.
Cigarette?
I have to talk to you.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
What? Palace? Hardly.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Better than when I was a child.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Mr. Roebush?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
I seem to be.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You thought that?
Some people don't think it's healthy.
Me??
Old ties are hard to cut.
Anyday...
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
Oh?
Kitchen. . . Technician
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
First paycheck?
One.  And a half.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Which country?
Columbia.
Columbia.
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
Just the man I wanted to see!
Uh...what channel were you watching?
God, that's what I keep you for.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
I didn't have my camera with me.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Gus?
He can have mine. Anytime.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Missing????
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Uh. . .
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
What??
I didn't think I wanted to.
We'd better talk.
Say you love me.
Let's get you inside . . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, hi.
What else could I do?
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Where?
To ski?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
What do you want?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Like me?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Go on . . .
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
Thank you.
Got it? Otis?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
North. It's north
I will.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
But otherwise it's swell.
He may have a gun!
Oh.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
No, you're going to get kissed,
Nothing.
I knew you'd hit me.
What are you going to do to him?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Then -
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Two.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
How good it felt!
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
It's not bad.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him steady employment --
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Of time, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
I understand.
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Your kids never cry.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Well I don't.
Berry-picking.
With our hands.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
The people in the town?
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
Thanks.
So what's the problem?
I need money.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Who did they get for that?
You think someone else caused the accident?
No.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Does it fit?
Do you like the colour?
Nothing.
Great.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
Hitler!
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
What does that mean - integrity?
Talk to her yourself...
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
You're sure.  Find out for me.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
In his apartment -
What sort of thing?
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I didn't do anything!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
If the stores are open -
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
I can't
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Why?
Right.
Smile?
Pain causes it?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I love you, John.  I always have.
SHOOT!!!!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
Please continue...
Relax now, Sarah --
Respect your elders and your betters!
But I promised your mother.
I'm very sorry.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwngler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Three months.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
How come?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Sure.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Who warned you?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
That's an outrageous lie!
And what did he say?
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Yes, you remember.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
We will, kiddo.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
What's that?
Kyle...
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.
Like shit, boss.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'll be right with you.
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Keep it.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Can we talk?
Is this you?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Not here!  They can see.
All I mean is... someone like you...
... what... ?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Let me show you...
Claire.
Boyfriend?
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
I redecorated.  What about you?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
How do you know?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Yes.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I know.
Oh, here we go...
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
What kind of vacation?
It's all down to this...
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
The key?
Have a nice day.
Goodnight then.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
What's this about?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Go ahead.
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
Yeah.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
That smell... oh, God.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
And then what happened?
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Why?
What?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Mary came with me.
It's okay... we're all here...
How could you do this to people?
You're okay.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
What's his first name?
Why?
I have a loft.
I don't know, you know...
Okay.
Just had to be sure.
Is that a problem?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
I'm a gracious host.
I sure hope so.
Okay.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Round about, yeah.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
Where abouts?
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Not me, man.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Again?
Hard to miss.
How'd you manage that, then.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
I might've been away for the weekend.
He give me your address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Have you ever known me not to be.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
I can see the attraction.
Hey?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
You ever been to London?
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Poor baby.
So what's your beef, pal?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
He had urgent business in the north.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Yeah.
Five thousand.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
What d'you mean, any happier?
There is?
Something's on.
You do?
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Since when?
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Ann--
Who?
Hello, Tony.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
That'll be fine.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
Uh-huh.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
OK.
...Huh?
Big Dave--
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
I, uh... thanks.
Oh, don't be a grump.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Mm.
How are you?
You don't have to--
I knew we'd pay for it.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...who among us is in a position to say...
So, who should I--
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Yeah.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
You don't got a headache?
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
His eyes are open.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
Oh Jesus...
What doors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Mind if I have a look?
So the method of death is the only connection?
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
They're eggs.
I think so.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
How many storage areas are there?
Not that big.
He's right.  Follow me.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Frock's been fired.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't understand.
How did you know that?
A monster?
Gone.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
For what?
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
What's to see?
All prop cars accounted for?
Why would we--
Why not?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
So when are you leaving?
I can't tonight.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I've got to show you something.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
What's that?
Gee, that's great.
I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
What?!
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
That's not true.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Truman, stop it!
You got it.
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
The whole area's being evacuated.
You're welcome, Truman.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Nothing completely conclusive --
Agent Mulder.
And if it's unsuccessful?
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Into what?
Who?
Kurtzweil, we think.
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I know the name. Why?
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
Not according to the men in blue.
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
Your guess?
You didn't know my father --
What's wrong, Scully?
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
-- Mulder! Get in the car!
What? What are you talking about?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
All the equipment is brand new.
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Been where?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
Thank you.
I've got to find Scully.
I have answers for you.
Yes.
I want to know where Scully is.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Give a kiss to Edward.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
That's what therapists are for, right?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
What happened to Charles Gish?
So you say.
No.  Thank you.
You're kidding me.
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
No.
Any psychiatric medication?
That's a secret.
What about the cat?
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
I don't have to.
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Das worren nooh zeiten.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He was Harry's driver?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Well you read this.
What's that?
Holly.
Yes.
What's the matter?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
He liked to laugh.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I saw him today.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
That's the reason.
There's nothing in them.
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Yes, of course.
No, sorry.
He was...
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
This is where he vanished.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
I said you win.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
I want to talk to you.
A Roumanian.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Now, hold on.
Well make it your business.
Something wrong.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Just five dollars, please.
Here.
Just take it, OK.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Thanks.
Good morning.
Why?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
A fin!
You can swim?
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
Incredible.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
No one follows that midrash.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They don't have extermination camps.
Who the fuck are you?
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Then I won't bring you....
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I don't care about money.
You will.
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Is he a Nazi?
Why won't you talk to me?
And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
I'm good at languages.
Why not?
That's stupid.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
What's it about?
Why should I submit?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
Danny, what about the Jews?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
He has Israel.
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Give me a reason not to.
The arguments, anyway.
This is me.
How did you...?
Think about your father. Your sister.
Balint?
Fine.
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Get out of here....
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
You said they didn't have night guards.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What are you trying to say?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
Do I give a shit?
Exactly.
Obviously.
What?
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Does he know?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
No!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
No.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Congratulations, Enzo.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
I won't, I swear.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
How many are, down there?
Lira?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
The rules are the rules.
Try speaking to me?
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
I dove 315 feet!
It's okay.
... Everything.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Well that's very nice of you.
We saw each other a little while ago.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Uh... Yes, of course!
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
You go back, I'll walk.
Why?
... Are you sure?
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
No.
He doesn't hear too well.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
They're going to send detectives.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Yes... It's magic.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Let him sleep.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
A stereo type alarm system?
Why not?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Nice fellow?
What about me?
You get your money from your husband.
You really think so, Charlie?
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
I want him to lock me up.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
The elderly man I told you about.
Go on -
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
That was a calamity!
Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
I know. Funerals.
Absolutely sure.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
I know -- Teresa -
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Will you please come with me?
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Disney! How inter...
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
...You-you spoke to him?
I dont.
You splendid bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
...Were turning in circles.
Something like that?
You seem to know what youre talking about.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...
Get to the point, will you...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I know where to look.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Have we done business before?
This is a bad line.
Yes... Good, good...
What about an untrained pup, white...
You... Fuck you!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where is he?
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youve got to get me out of here...
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
How are you, Jane?
Oh... We split up.
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Los Angeles?
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
Gluck.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Costliest!
Of course I am, it's just that...
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
Good.
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
It would not be the same without you.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Yes...
And when was that?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Not long ago...
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
You have nothing to regret...
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
That's not a lot.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
For what?
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The bridge won't wait!
Me too...
No good?  This is a disaster!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
But my voices... they promised me...
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I -- I -- I...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
I... I never lied!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
What do you mean, they won't come?
What signs?
No...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Him?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
What... does he... look like?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Calm down, what, what is it?
Funny time to say this.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We use what?
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You'll be deported.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Pig!
Where are we going?
No, I don't think so?
A pianist.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
On your property?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Yes, I suppose you would.
You don't want to learn.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
You mean in signs?
I just want to listen.
What happened?
It's quite safe, they are managing...
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Do I know any gigs?
All right if I look around your lobby?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
What do we do?
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
I had some appointments.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I picked something up on the way.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
Yeh, it was easy.
What do ya mean?
And?
Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Then why you doin' it?
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
I'll square it with the fixer.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
He'd like to kill me.
Okay, Tootsie.
Then why the rat?
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
How am I gonna do that?
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
He was?
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Go!
What are you talking about?
Then what are you hiding?
Now do you believe me!
Macaulay.
tried him once -
I bought it in a pawn shop.
He's been dead for three months.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He's all right.
Better get home before it is.
Not at all.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
No.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
I didn't know they had a fight.
No.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
All right.  All right.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
You're going to return every cent of it!
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You dog!
He was down in the shop.
Well, don't they?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Who do you think did it?
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I wish you'd tell me who.
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
No... no.
You his wife?
Yes.
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Y-yes.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Oh, God.
No, please, not again.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
For climbing.
We can't just go off and--
Ready when you are.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
I told you; don't push me around.
We're at war.
What if I do?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
I did it!  I got the box open.
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
...I know.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What?
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
With what?  Against how many?
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
What?
I could use some recon photos too.
Yeah, you're funny.
For real?  A treasure?
You will.  You'll get it.
Like I said; so?
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Oh, Jesus!
We got to get out of here.
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
You have to go with us, Wes.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
We have to do something.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Violation?
What's the matter with you?
Eat your dinner.
Now?
Looks like dirt.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
Don't take anything.
I don't want to lose you.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
We're leaving.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
...and you're not lost now?
Look more closely.
What?
No!....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
No......  She's dead THX........
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
And you are...?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Only once, at Redstone.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Yep.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Helluva fuck factor.
Thank you.
Maybe she knows your old man.
A ticking bomb...
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
What was it this time?
It's about this.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
That feeling won't last long.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
In a moment.
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
About tonsils.
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
No.
Constantinople?
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Doc--!
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I don't want to see you at all!
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
M'sieu ...
No--no.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Yes.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
No. What is it? Tell me.
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Good night.
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I don't believe it!
Goodbye.
Goodbye ... 
What is it, madame?
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Yes, madame!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
About what?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Thank you, Rose.
Hurry, Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Don't drop it Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
No, trust me, you want to take this call.
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I felt like black.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
No you won't.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
I know what ice fishing is!
I've got you. I won't let go.
Yes, exactly!
So don't marry him.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Just move with me. Don't think.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
That's enough.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
I should like to see my drawing.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Excuse me.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
How'd you ever get away with it?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
Where's Lother?
Get moving--
Not at all.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
We'll let it go at that--
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Lose?--I won a little--
What do you know about them?
Make it five.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
--there's thousands of 'em!
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Change?
Are you screwy?
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
What is it?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Where did you hide it?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
How?
Sure.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
She's in New York.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Very serious?
Meaning what?
Somebody's got to do it--
Eh?... Oh.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
You leave the kid alone.
You can't bluff me any more.
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
I sincerely hope so--
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Nice voice.
That's not what I meant.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
This brand.
You retired, too?
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Credat Judaeus Apella.
I was kidding about that.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Awful lot of money.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Colorado's closer
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I laugh sometimes
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Just doesn't, that's all.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Fortuitous even.
Always?
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Well I'm real scared.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
I know, I need a keeper.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
None of my business, Fred.
Admiral, are you suggesting -
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Sir Elliot.
Sightseeing.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
...Words to live by?
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your time -
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Shhhhh...
How is old Q?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
That's reassuring.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
What do you mean?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
We blast through.
Next time, I do the driving.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
I was an attorney!
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Excellent.
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Maybe. Maybe not.
Junior spends time with his child.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I'm busy.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
It would be nice.
I will appreciate that.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Hattie is a different person now.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
That's nice.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
My mother passed on years ago.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
What must I do?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Okay.
Just one?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Here!  In the car!
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Mm-hmmmmm.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Then we've no time to lose!!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Woody!  The rocket!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Look!  Janie!
She's sick!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Will you quit moving around?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Slink!  Hang on!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
You're only a young thing.
Living with him put years on me.
Ah, come on now!
H'm?
So did I.
Nothing is left but us.
We're too young.
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
I can't find Manolo.
How much?
Nine thousand dollars.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
That's frustrating.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Barbara --
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
What do you think?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Helena --
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
You want to make a wager on this?
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
We're playing!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
When will you do it?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Your new friends.
We keep our mouths shut.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Only if he can be trusted.
It's possible.
Any way we can do it better?
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
Oh, man --
Agents who died in the field.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Ninteen.
Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
I've no fucking cigarettes.
Great.
What?
I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Eh-
Ssshh!
What? Steady like?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Following the game at all?
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Yeah.
Would not say no, would not say no.
Screenwriter?
Who wrote it?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Did he -- you know?
How much?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Stick it on my tab.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
A walk.
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Plotting our new course.
Closing.
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
But how?
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Are we leaving, Captain?
Goodnight, Doctor.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Let me do something.
A "t."
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I don't control minds. I free them.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
No. You must kill me.
I belong here.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Want one?
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Of what?
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
How 'bout yourself?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Where are you going?
Where are you off to young lady?
Yeah, right.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
You're kidding.
Here, check these out.
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Son of a bitch!
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
She's having an affair.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Here they come.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
But you didn't.  Why not?
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Yeah.  It was great.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Answer the question--
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Sure, hon.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Are we going to die?
What about Juno?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
What about the husbands?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
Go ahead.
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Worse than Cairo?							*
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
This is great, we got cable.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Want some Goobers?
Sonny kicks ass.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
'Bout twelve.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
That's a long time.
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Is he nice?
What did he do to Arlene?
This motherfucker sounds charming!
Will you be my wife?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
What?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Why Cancoon?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
He don't got no right to live.
No thanks.
It's great to hear from you.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Good for you.
I know.
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Look, Dick, I don't -
What do you think, eightball?
Get on your knees.
No.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Thank you very much, Clarence.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Keep it.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Uh-huh.
Not a tiny little vial -
You're no longer an extra -
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
I have to go.
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Jeffrey Mason?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
The gun! ... I lost it
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I'm not crazy.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
I'm here about some monkeys.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Yes, sir.
Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
You really want to know?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Maybe I do.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You afraid of the dark?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
That's my morning's pay.
One way, or round trip?
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What's it to you?
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
I . . .
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
You didn't hear something?
What does it look like?
I'm just going to my car.
May I carry your package, Grace?
Yes, I have.
I just drove in this morning.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
You just walk away.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
There has to be!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Give him the money.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
But I want to say with you,
I think I busted my leg.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Talk?  About what?
I do.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
What should I do?
SHUT UP!
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
It's the truth, Jake.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Oz.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Will you shut up!
You expect me to believe that?
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
Give it to me!
This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
The old lady?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
No!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
What do you want for free?
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
You expect me to believe that?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I'm her husband.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
It ain't broke.
Accident.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Darrell's a moron.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Like you don't know.
Would you kill her?
You meant it.
That's a bit much.
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
You're too quick for me.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
How old are you?
Get away from me!
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Don't look like nothing.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Beautiful?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Is that why you're with him?
Don't feel like nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
No! You get it!
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
But I thought --
You already have.
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
I busted my leg!
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Wow.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Seventy-five percent.
Are you for real?
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What things?
No.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Is David Dunne there?
Against a window.
How did you get together?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
On a bench, across the street.
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
I could run off them whores.
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
Letters?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Then... what?
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
N-no, sir?
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Lookin' at?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
I got him.
Yeah.
Tell me right off if you see him.
First one what?
Lemmee see it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
You ain't like that no more.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
Two more hogs got the fever.
K-k-kill somebody?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Fuck you.
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
Bear with me here...
They'll never stop.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Edie, please.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
What if I
This I had to see myself.
What about Redfoot?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
You didn't know.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Two hours, tops.
You know damn well what I think.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I just want to hear your story.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Kobayashi.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
... tell me about this case.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Say it.
...We did everything we could...
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Yes.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
Then why don't you testify?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...
Overruled...
I can't guarantee that...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
And what are you?  A cop?
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
That's what I am.
You, you don't under...
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
No.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm going to get laid.
That's right.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What difference can that make...? All right...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Hi.  How are you doing?
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
What did she say?
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
I married into it.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Someone dead.
How often does this happen?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
You.
Judy Barton.
An hour?
Mmm.
Don't go.
Why?!
Yes --
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Judy --
Yes.
Is that the best you can do?
Too late. I've got my face on.
No, Ernie's is fine.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Scottie --
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
What are you going to do?
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
What?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Where?
The tall trees...
Have you been here before?
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
I'm here, I've got you...
Only this far.
Tell me.
Yes?! But --
No... we're together...
Please let me go.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Why?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Pop Leibel? Sure.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Out!
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Naturally.
What is it, a still life?
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
I thought so!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Name one.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
I don't know why the floor was wet!
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
You're a loser.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What do you think you are doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Have you ever done this before?
We can't do this.
We've already done this.
So that's what we're doing.
Don't talk to me about character.
Nobody's smoking anybody out.
What?
Later.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
Shut up.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
I just want to get married.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Yeah.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
What's your point?
There's my point exactly.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
What?
We missed the deadline.
What do you mean, you think so?
Sent it.
Caterer?
I think so.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
Are we going to do this again?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
You will not be common!!!
How much?
Kiss me...?
I'm mad at you.
How late?
What?
Do you love me?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
Buzzing?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
How do you know she's dead.
What?
A move?
That's what I'm thinking.
Yup.
Give them to Refugio.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Yes, yes.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And this innocent child.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
You must listen to me before you go.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Why?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
No.
Things seem to be getting better.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Where?
Yes -- very, very big!
They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
When you are, miss.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
Whatever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Their weapons missing?
Where's my gun?
What's the assignment?
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?
I'M WHAT?!
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
It was you, wasn't it?
Enough!
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
My...secret.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
What can it hurt.
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...and...
Oh, Lord....
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
Yes
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
In the yellow ribbon.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
Does it <u>have</u> to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's <u>Italy</u>...Look at the tie-in here:  <u>The</u> <u>Boot</u>, "Givvem the <u>Boot</u>,"... If we were to go Wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Where is he?
Out in Oklahoma.
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I have a question for you.
...you the Press Office?
...Good...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Why Albania?
Why not?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
"Freedom."
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Of what?
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Finish Strong!  Are you <u>nuts</u>?  Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from <u>Heaven</u>... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
A proud tradition.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
Watch me.
No problem.  Here's the...
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
They don't know what's going on!
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Then get out and close it behind you.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
About what?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
I met them before you were born.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
What? How do you know about my father?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
What does that mean?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Gordon.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
He still likes you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Allow me sir
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
What?  Tony and China, together?
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Big deal!
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
I know that.
Of course you will.
Why?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Do you?
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
You're the flower lady.
Um...yes.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
Wait!  Don't go...
You do?
Um...sure.
Please leave me alone.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
It's niiice.
Telling you...
I don't...
Then what was it?
Adamant?
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Like what?
It's okay if you're not.
Nope.
I know.
Did you call the police?
Wow.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
You didn't?
Did you call about the Feurs?
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Tonight?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
We're going to be fine.
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Then where is she?
In the living room...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Your wife...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
I never asked you to quit!
Stop...
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Two what...?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Every day  twice.
Then you wear it.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
'He'...?
Stop it!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Now, lasher - it is our time.
It is from love.
If you knew how I yearn for that...
I bring her flowers too.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
Leave me alone!
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
Yessss...
My jury's still out on that,
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Captain's orders.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Mad. for each other.
Rowan...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
You bastard!
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
If you like that type.
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
All the time?
Yes - I have had it for years.
Yes, one and a half please.
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't want to talk about it -
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
You heard me - keep away from him
Yes I can...
Is LESLIE here?
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
Yes - of course.
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Yes - one please.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
Check it out!
Dead?
Let me get this straight...
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Which you pulled, hard!
You have changed since second grade.
I mean, what do you think?
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
I'm getting so good at this.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
You ordered a Winnebago?
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Everything.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
I'm trying to help.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
To the best hiding place in the world.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That's refreshingly deviant.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
That's hard to believe.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
I have only one concern...
As much as possible.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
People pay good money for that?
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I... You know... I...
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
Just check out the car.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Why is that?
What was that?
What about witnesses?
And what do they say?
Yeah... okay... he did
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I think we just need to get wasted.
Sam!  Hi!
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Duquette.  Forget him...
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Say you love me.
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
That's right.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Story's the same, Detective...
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
All that jumping and kicking.
That's right... That's good.
What way is that?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Thank you.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
This is Colonel Richards.
On my way to Denver...
He had a pressing engagement.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Yes!
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
You're not a woman.
Miserable Pecks.
What is it?
Because she's sick.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
What's the magician's weapon?
The limitless power of...
There's nobody here.
More!  More!
Who??
How are we going to get out there?
Pretty much.
Yes, sir.
No pistol. Ever.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Yeah.
What have you got?
Maybe.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
It's not a joke.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
No.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
We had some lemonade and he left.
A real fireball.
I was being foolish?
Where's my baggy pants?
Johnny, what the fuck?
Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Say again?
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
Tight. But I'm working on him.
You might have killed him!
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
If she...
Goodbye, folks!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
What's she doing now?
Oh, no -- no!
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Look -- it ticks!
Oh, my!
Yes.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Because I'm still scared!
Ohh!
Oh --
Ohhh!
Don't you start it, too!
I don't know.
That's right.
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
No, her dog!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Oh - look out.
It's a whozis?
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Yeah --
It makes you nervous?
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Yes -- ....
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Is maybe...the inside woman.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
I have to go to work.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
...what?
Soon shell be everywhere.
Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
A rope!
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
Where?
Of course...
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Collect me?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
You're the only human being I care for.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
She's with me.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Antarctica??
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Don't look.  Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Looks like a diner.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
What do I get out of it?
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
You don't have to do that.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
That's would be me.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Alright, so I'll get more.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
We all do.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Into the Hudson?
It's too far.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
How?
I felt like she almost killed me.
A piece.  Only a piece.
ALIVE.
What do you want with him?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
What do you mean to do?
It does indeed, Max.
And who might you be?
Ugly, vicious rumous.
From your office, sir.
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Surprised!
All right then!
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
How old are you, young man?
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I beg your pardon?
No.
How?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Tonight?
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
It wasn't me.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Me?  Sing?
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
Good night!
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
