__Leonard Okay.
__Sheldon Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.
__Leonard Hi.
__Penny Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbour, Penny.
__Leonard Don't.
__Sheldon No.
__Sheldon Oh, of course.
__Leonard It's Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.
__Raj It's fantastic. Unbelievable.
__Howard It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
__Penny It's okay if you say no.
__Leonard What did I just…. Uh, we're here to pick up Penny's TV.
__Sheldon Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
__Sheldon A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.
__Sheldon Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.
__Leonard You think?
__Leonard Sure, that's another way to go.
__Raj Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?
__Penny Leonard.
__Sheldon Check.
__Penny Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.
__Sheldon I'm a rogue knight elf, don't you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked “buy it now.”
__Howard Because he looked better than you?
__Leonard Hey, what's going on.
__Leonard I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.
__Leonard Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.
__Leonard No,  You were saying, but…
__Leonard Then I guess congratulations are in order.
__Penny I'm sorry?
__Penny You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
__Penny Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.
__Sheldon I know, but why?
__Mrs Cooper He gets his temper from his daddy.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.
__Raj Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.
__Sheldon Statistically unlikely.
__Lesley Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
__Penny Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.
__Penny We really shouldn't be standing here.
__Leonard Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?
__Lesley No-one.
__Sheldon Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
__Lesley Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Leonard Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
__Penny Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing…
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.
__Girl A brain damaged choo-choo train?
__Sheldon You have a back-up hypothesis.
__Sheldon True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?
__Penny You really think so, don't you?
__Howard's phone Howard' Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?
__Leonard So? We'll start now.
__Raj We can split it two, two and two.
__Howard Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you're new in town.
__Penny I'm listening.
__Penny Got it.
__Sheldon Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.
__Christie Howard?
__Leonard For one thing you live with your mother.
__Raj That works.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
__Howard Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon It's Halo night.
__Penny Told yah!
__Leonard I thought I heard something.
__Sheldon It says keep this on your person at all times.  It's right here under Batman's signature.
__Raj No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.
__Leonard Oh, hey.
__Leonard Um… Raj.
__Penny Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but… you've been talking to me.
__Sheldon That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
__Lalita Oh.
__Sheldon The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.
__Raj If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
__Lalita Sheldon, are you hungry?
__Leonard Beats the hell out of me.
__Leonard Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
__Leonard Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.
__Howard Public access enabled.
__Sheldon No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.
__Penny Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!
__Leonard Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
__Penny Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
__Leonard Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.
__Leonard Any other questions?
__Leonard Really, so why did you come?
__Sheldon So you admit that you're an egotist?
__Howard More often than you'd think.
__Penny You wanna prowl, be my night owl,  we'll take my…  Hey guys, hi! Where you going?
__Penny It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.
__Sheldon I think I know.
__Leonard No, it's this Friday, at eight.
__ Leonard closes door.
__Sheldon No, of course not, there's no cousin Leo, there's no intervention, focus Leonard.
__Leonard So he goes back into rehab?
__Sheldon For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
__Howard Wow.
__Penny Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
__Penny Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.
__Toby Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.
__Penny Hi Leo, how are you feeling?
__Toby Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!
__Sheldon Your parents made the right decision.
__Sheldon Think woman, who blew their nose and when?
__ Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!
__Sheldon Leonard, where are you?
__Leonard Then make soup.
__Sheldon In the lab?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?
__Howard Chocolate milk and eggoes please!
__Penny We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.
__Raj Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?
__Together Dr Gablehouser.
__Gablehouser Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we're hoping to have him do his graduate work here.
__Sheldon Nope. Goodbye.
__Dennis Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.
__Dennis It's startling to me you haven't considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.
__Dennis Have you considered it?
__Dennis Wow, you won the Stephenson award.
__Sheldon What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
__Leonard If he were, I wouldn't be.
__Sheldon No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.
__Goldfarb Go away.
__Gablehouser There's the man of the hour.
__Howard Or can we?
__Raj Okay, uh, how about her?
__Dennis What?
__Howard Yeah, let's go with that.
__Penny Right.
__Sheldon What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
__Penny Yeah, and the bag it came in.
__Sheldon Gentlemen.
__Sheldon Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?
__Raj Holy crap.
__Third Floor Janitor Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.
__Sheldon Alright that is very immature.
__Raj Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it's rough.
__Leonard Come on, snipers.
__Howard Why don't we share it? We'll each put in two hundred bucks and we'll take turns having it in our homes.
__Raj A time share time machine? I'm in. Sheldon?
__Howard It's actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound.
__Leonard Let's just do this. Guys, ready to push?
__Raj He's got a point.
__Raj Twice a month.
__Leonard That doesn't sound too bad.
__Leonard Because I don't want it any more.
__Howard Why?
__Sheldon My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.
__Leonard No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.
__Leonard He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
__Penny What?
__Penny No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.
__Leonard Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and… you know… move on with my life.
__Leonard So, how do you two know each other.
__Sheldon Rajesh.
__Howard Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
__Missy And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
__Raj Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
__Sheldon I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.
__Sheldon So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.
__Raj Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.
__Sheldon I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.
__Sheldon What's the difference?
__Leonard Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?
__Leonard No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.
__Sheldon What would we talk about? We've no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.
__Penny Okay, can you just let me in.
__Sheldon That's because I didn't bring one.
__Howard What if guests show up?
__Leonard Fine.
__Leonard Seen it.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny Okay, let's go.
__Howard No, you don't understand.
__Leonard Why not?
__Howard Don't toy with me, woman.
__Penny I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.
__Penny Happy birthday anyways.
__Howard You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
__Sheldon Mai du lui tsa.
__Leonard Yeah, no, sure.
__Penny Really, do you think I overreacted?
__Leonard Yeah, that must get old quick.
__Penny No.
__Penny Right, thanks.
__Sheldon You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.
__Leonard Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.
__Leonard Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
__Penny You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
__Howard Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?
__Sheldon Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.
__Leonard Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
__Sheldon Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
__Leonard Hi.
__Howard Like who?
__Sheldon I don't like bearclaws.
__Leonard It changed.
__Sheldon Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
__Sheldon You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
__Leslie No there isn't, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
__Penny Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.
__Sheldon Sheldor, back online.
__Sheldon You're okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.
__Penny Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.
__Leonard Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?
__Sheldon Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.
__Leonard-warrior's head Leonard-warrior' Okay, maybe later.
__Leonard Penny's been keeping him up at night.
__Leslie I'm not touching that.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?
__Raj Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.
__Sheldon What people?
__Raj Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.
__Raj It has more food too.
__Leonard It's not a date, and that's racist.
__Leonard You want to breed a new friend?
__Sheldon But how am I going to get to work?
__Sheldon If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on. That's why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it's not fine.
__Sheldon You're going up Euclid Avenue?
__Sheldon Okay. I'll give it a shot.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Homo Novus doesn't know.
__Leonard Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
__Leslie Winkle Hey, guys.
__Penny Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
__Penny Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
__Sheldon Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.
__Ramona And who was that great man?
__Sheldon He does on Wednesdays.
__Penny Yeah, he's a gift all right.
__Ramona Sheldon, what are you doing out of bed?
__Sheldon Godzilla clause?
__Sheldon And I could not have done it without you.
__Ramona Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.
__Sheldon Maybe when I publish it, I'll include an inhaler.
__ That's it. No more Thai food.
__Sheldon Is qochbe' spelled with a  or a ?
__Sheldon Individual relish packets?
__Sheldon Who touched my…
__Penny I did?
__Sheldon Leonard, she's in my spot.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Really? Well, that's great.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She's a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won't care she's not Jewish.
__Sheldon Snap what?
__Penny Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
__Sheldon So you brought me in here to inform me that you can't tell me where you're going and you can't tell me who might ask?
__Girl Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.
__Penny Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
__Howard Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea!  Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?
__Sheldon Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.
__Steph What is he doing?
__Sheldon Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who's Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?
__Penny What?
__Raj During which she defected to North Korea.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
__Sheldon Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.
__Leonard No, you're not.
__Sheldon You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.
__Penny Roommate? You guys are living together?
__Steph Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I'm feeling?
__Steph I think that's for swimming.
__Leonard Good.
__Penny Good, good. And then what?
__Sheldon It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you've done since you've been here completely useless.
__Leonard Hey, guys!
__Howard That doesn't count. Do over! Do over!
__Leonard Actually, he's pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
__Penny Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
__Penny Ha. Well, that's what I am, queen of the nerds.
__Raj Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff, let's just go next door and build her a bear.
__Sheldon That presupposes Penny is tense.
__Leonard Yeah, I know. I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
__Penny Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
__Penny Why are you yelling at me?
__Leonard Lactose.
__Sheldon Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
__Raj How about “Die, toaster, die”?
__Leonard Wow.
__Penny Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
__Howard Hey, I'm a big boy. I'm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.
__Sheldon Do it.
__Howard I'm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!
__Howard What a jerk.
__Leonard Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.
__Penny Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
__Sheldon Hi.
__Sheldon I don't see how you could.
__Sheldon It's a terrific book. I've distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
__Sheldon So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there's any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.
__Sheldon I'm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
__Sheldon Won't it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you're living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
__Penny Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
__Sheldon No.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Dinner's here.
__Penny Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
__Penny Well, do you know anybody?
__Penny Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
__Howard Not a clue.
__Leonard's Mother Leonard' Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.
__Beverley Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley One teaspoon sugar?
__Beverley You'll have to be more specific.
__Leonard Please, don't go there, Howard.
__Raj Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.
__Howard Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?
__Penny Geez, what a fun couple.
__Leonard She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
__Penny A hugging machine?
__Penny That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.
__Howard No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
__Leslie You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.
__Howard Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
__Sheldon I'm not unhappy.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
__Leonard You're welcome.
__Leonard Wackadoodle.
__Leslie Oh, didn't you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn't make the cut.
__Penny Sit on the damn couch.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.
__Raj You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.
__Howard Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.
__Leonard Right. Of course.
__Summer You're not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?
__Howard But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?
__Summer I'm sorry. This is me.
__All Ah.
__Howard You underestimate me.
__Penny Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
__Penny Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.
__Raj What's the matter?
__Howard It's a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.
__Sheldon – What's wrong with it?
__Penny So?
__Penny Here, this will help.
__ Look at Planck's Constant. People say it's arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let's reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that's not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we're being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let's call it universe prime, there's another Sheldon, let's call him Sheldon prime…
__Leonard Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
__Sheldon Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.
__Alicia Sounds like a sweet deal.
__Alicia Whatever you think is best, cutie.
__Sheldon Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
__Alicia But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.
__Penny …chinese food right here.
__Penny Well, you know, it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.
__Howard According to Alicia's facebook page, she's hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.
__Howard I'm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
__Howard You let go.
__Leonard Sure, why not?
__Stuart Hey, guys.
__Sheldon Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It's the buggy beta version.
__Raj Fine. I'll have a chocolate martini.
__Leonard What about the ones in the corner?
__Howard I can't sit on your lap, you don't know the routine.
__Leonard God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.
__Raj Interesting. Are you a Droid?
__Raj Are you Spock?
__Sheldon You know, I'm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.
__Raj Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
__Sheldon Where?
__Raj Uh, actually, if it's not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.
__Sheldon Sing soft kitty.
__Howard They're on me today, boys.
__Sheldon Said the Grinch to Christmas.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Oh, hi.
__Sheldon At times.
__Howard Classified, Leonard.
__Sheldon It won't work. No way to mount it.
__Howard Okay, here's an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?
__Leonard All right, then go.
__Raj We could play outside.
__All Yeah! Woo-hoo!
__Howard We're not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?
__ Penny.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
__Sheldon All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.
__Leonard I guess I'll see you.
__Sheldon Three months. This is gonna be great!
__Raj For me, it was a bonding moment.
__Howard That's why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
__Raj He just went colon, capital O.
__Leonard Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's… don't ask.
__Kripke Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein's cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you're still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.
__Penny So, how do you know he ran away?
__Penny Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
__Mrs Cooper This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all…
__Howard Hello? I'm wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys' large they had.
__Mrs Cooper Hi, boys.
__Raj Give it up, dude, you're arguing with a crazy person.
__Leonard No, look, Mumbai Palace.
__Leonard Trust me, this will be just fine.
__Leonard What?
__Raj What would you name him?
__Sheldon Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I'll suck nothing. Of course I'm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
__Howard That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?
__Sheldon Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Sheldon Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
__Sheldon I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
__Leonard Sheldon! it's an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
__Sheldon Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
__Leonard What was that?
__Howard Really?
__Howard Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?
__Sheldon Thank you. Chocolate?
__Raj Goth food.
__Raj That sounds really cool.
__Sheldon You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?
__Leonard Yes.
__Raj What is your mother going to say?
__Tattooist Okay, here we go.
__Howard What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
__Leonard Unbelievable.
__Howard Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It's not as good as it sounds.
__Howard Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.
__Sheldon Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
__Raj Okay, uh, please don't take this the wrong way, but I'd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.
__Raj Thank you.
__Raj Wha… You're kidding!
__Penny Oh, God, how did he know?
__Raj My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.
__Leonard Just play a potion card.
__Sheldon You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
__Penny And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
__Raj No doubt, sign here.
__Howard Do you like science-fiction?
__Leonard I had to ask. You didn't have to say yes.
__Bernadette Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
__Bernadette Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?
__Sheldon Sorry won't bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
__Howard Oh come on, you're not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?
__Sheldon Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
__Raj And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you're not even there.
__Sheldon Thank you. I'd like to make a sandwich, but I'm out of bread.
__Penny So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend. He is really smart.
__Raj If you want to chase after her, chase after her.
__Leonard We must not be playing it right.
__Leonard Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
__Penny Well, he's definitely not gay.
__Sheldon I'll just roll for you.
__Leonard I'm not talking to you like you're an idiot! I'm saying the whole idea is idiotic!
__Sheldon Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny's forfeit, you have become the world's first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
__Leonard No, there isn't! They're synonyms!
__Sheldon Aren't you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
__Penny Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
__Sheldon That's actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn't agree with it.
__Penny Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?
__Mrs Koothrappali Sheldon, ask our son what we're supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Penny Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
__Sheldon The ducks in my tub.
__Penny Ow.
__Leonard Of course, they did. That's what grandmothers do.
__Howard Cookie?
__Leonard All right, everyone grab flashlights.
__Sheldon Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
__Raj Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
__Penny What?
__Howard Ouch.
__Leonard Let me guess, motion sensors?
__Howard Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
__Bernadette That's amazing.
__Penny It's not about shoes.
__Leonard Yeah? So?
__Sheldon How else are you gonna study for the tests?
__Bernadette It unhooks in the front.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Howard, I'm home!
__Penny Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
__Leonard Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
__Bernadette Come here, tushy face.
__Sheldon No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
__Leonard Oh, glad you're here, uh, sit down, I'll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
__Leonard Mitzy's dead?
__Sheldon That's not the comforting part.
__Beverley What?
__Leonard Are you guys drunk?
__Beverley Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
__Raj What about me?
__Sheldon I'm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that's linked to race riots in the 1940s.
__Raj I don't know, it's a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I'm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.
__Sheldon Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?
__Sheldon When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.
__Abby Ooh, India.
__Penny Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
__Howard Had a great night last night. I don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.
__ What's your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can't do that, Howard.
__Sheldon Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.
__ Credits sequence.
__Policeman What?
__Leonard It's getting scary here, too.
__Penny Sheldon, are you okay?
__Leonard Oh, no, he's going to telecommute. Everybody's really excited about it.
__Sheldon Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town's Chamber of Commerce.  Wait! Wait! Excuse me!  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.
__Penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
__Sheldon Don't be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
__Penny For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
__Bernadette Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.
__Bernadette I'm going to count to three. One…
__Leonard For God's sakes. Sheldon, come here!
__Penny Sheldon, what do you want?
__Sheldon Einstein.
__Penny Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
__Howard Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.
__Sheldon In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.
__Raj The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
__Sheldon Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?
__Sheldon Shame on you! That's no dream for a scientist!
__Leonard No.
__Raj No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?
__Leonard What's going on?
__Leonard You hate Babylon 5.
__Penny I'll talk to Leonard.
__Leonard Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!
__Sheldon I don't think you're fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.
__Raj That's a great idea, I'm going to get him to sign a Batman as well.
__Howard You are guilty. (Raj's shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked.
__Leonard That's what I'm saying.
__Penny Penny.
__Penny Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
__Leonard For what?
__Stan Lee Oh, damn.
__Penny Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
__Leonard Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
__Howard It's sad how great that sounds.
__Howard Don't you talk about my mother's boobies!
__Raj Why don't we go after your mother?
__Raj It's, it's not working, dude.
__Sheldon And I appreciate the pretence.
__Sheldon In the prom department.
__Sheldon I was wearing size a million pants.
__Leonard Uh-uh, give it a minute.
__Leonard You're welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
__Leonard Good night.
__Sheldon For the record, giant rats are possible.
__Raj I'm just asking, dude. It happens.
__Stuart You guys still on for bowling tonight?
__Howard Did you ask her to start waxing?
__Sheldon Well, well, well. If it isn't Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.
__Penny Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
__Penny Yeah, that's right.
__Sheldon Well, if he does, don't believe it. He's not above playing the dead meemaw card.
__Leonard Okay, I'm sorry. I'll shut up.
__Leonard I'm pretty sure it's already over.
__Sheldon Wheaton!
__Sheldon Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.
__Sheldon Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
__Penny Great.
__Leonard So, you guys want to do something tonight?
__Sheldon Do you have a stomach ache, too?
__Penny No. Why, do you?
__Raj You don't know that. Prison changes people.
__Leonard Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it's fine.
__Leonard It's ten o'clock, where have you been?
__Howard Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.
__Sheldon My room, of course.
__Sheldon Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
__Leonard Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I'm smart.
__Elizabeth Good to know.
__Elizabeth You, too.
__Elizabeth I thought you already read it.
__Elizabeth Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see  a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble's constant.
__Elizabeth More than pleasant.
__Penny I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.
__Raj Relax, it's Nyquil.
__Elizabeth Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?
__Leonard Elizabeth? What's going on?
__Sheldon Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
__Leonard For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
__Penny So, what, that's it? You've stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
__Leonard It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work…
__Past Howard Hey.
__Past Sheldon I don't like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
__Past Raj Me, too.
__Past Howard So do I.
__Past Raj Cool.
__Past Leonard Okay, I've had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
__Leonard Okay, I'm sorry.
__Sheldon Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?
__Leonard Your company?
__Zack Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.
__Penny Oh! That's very cool.
__Sheldon Make it so.
__Leonard Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
__Penny Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.
__Leonard How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
__Raj The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
__Raj Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.
__Amy Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.
__Sheldon Now.
__Sheldon If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?
__Leonard Yeah?
__Amy Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
__Howard What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.
__Leonard How about an acetylene torch?
__Amy That's an amusing factoid.
__Sheldon I should think so.
__Howard It's a robot arm.
__Sheldon But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
__Leonard Never mind. I got it.
__Howard He said if he had woman parts, he'd eat for free the rest of his life.
__Sheldon No, thank you. I'm not eating pizza tonight.
__Penny But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.
__Penny Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
__Sheldon No, the Flash shirt is because it's Friday, but it's nice when things work out. Where's your heart rate monitor?
__Penny Oh, my God, are you okay?
__Leonard Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
__Sheldon I'm behind you. Please look at me when you're talking to me.
__Sheldon No, you're not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
__Sheldon Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
__Leonard Why? What's the problem?
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- You think you have me stymied, don't you?
__Leonard Of course you must.
__Sheldon-bot  Sheldon- Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
__Steve Wozniak Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.
__Amy Isn't it obvious?
__Leonard This is ridiculous. You're just making stuff up.
__Raj Don't ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
__Sheldon I believe she's experiencing her menses.
__Amy Actually, I'm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.
__Howard You're not doing that right.
__Howard More like Yoko and Yoko.
__Leonard Zazzles?
__Penny What's up?
__Mrs Wolowitz I think it shrunk! I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!
__Sheldon Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don't need desks.
__Sheldon All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.
__Penny Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.
__Howard Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
__Penny Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
__Penny Well, what was your side?
__Sheldon Help me move my desk.
__Raj No.
__Raj Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.
__Sheldon Stand by for my upcoming tat.
__Howard Okay, fine. I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I've ever gone there is because I don't have a real woman in my life. You happy?
__Leonard No. Steve Patterson told me.
__Bernadette Mm! What are you doing?
__Bernadette Oh, not now. We're starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
__Sheldon No point. It's just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
__Leonard Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend, Sheldon's got a girl…
__Sheldon You're welcome. But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
__Sheldon Screwed.
__Howard So, how'd it go?
__Sheldon As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.
__Sheldon I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me and compel me to meet her mother.
__Amy All right.
__Leonard And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
__Sheldon Why would I touch her, she's covered with airplane germs.
__Howard Okay, forget who's hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.
__Sheldon The fun starts with brunch at Carney's in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we're off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that's right, the Hollywood Carney's, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.
__Leonard Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
__Priya Aha, you're funny.
__Leonard Air freshener.
__Leonard What alibi?
__Leonard Where did you get that?
__Leonard Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
__Sheldon I'm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn't notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?
__Sheldon Interesting. So you're saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
__Penny What?
__Howard Not really.
__Sheldon Nevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.
__Sheldon Did Leonard? I'm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. I'm eight for 26 this month.
__Leonard Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn' Nemesis.
__Sheldon Wait, now, we don't know that yet. He isn't finished. I have a girlfriend and you don't who?
__Amy Girls' night? What does that entail?
__Bernadette Oh, you never were?
__Sheldon Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.
__Amy My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
__Sheldon I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I'm a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?
__Amy I'm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia's list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.
__Penny What the hell was that?
__Raj Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you're back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?
__Leonard Yeah, no, I don't think so.
__Bernadette Hold on. Wait. No, it's okay, go ahead.
__Sheldon Leonard, Penny, excellent. I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I'd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny's annoying personal habits.
__Raj Where?
__Wyatt Just don't panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
__Leonard Hey.
__Leonard You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?
__Howard No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.
__Sheldon Well, you're the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.
__Sheldon All right, let's start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?
__Sheldon Zack.
__Amy Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
__Sheldon A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.
__Howard Ding!
__Howard It's a bell.
__Sheldon Please don't drag this out. This is never going to come off.
__Leonard Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.
__Sheldon Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
__Sheldon That's not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
__Penny What?
__Penny Wait, why me? Wh-Why can't your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
__Penny Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.
__Raj Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
__Sheldon Don't worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
__Zack Yes.
__Sheldon No, wait! I have a speech.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Well, hang on. Let's see where he's going.
__Leonard Okay, that's it, you're fired.
__Howard We're going to be hundred-aires.
__Leonard It's an annual science conference. We've all been invited to speak.
__Penny No, I really, I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
__Sheldon I knew she wasn't lead car material.
__Penny You know what? I missed you, too.
__Howard Hi. Ow. Hi.
__Howard Hey, Bernie?
__Amy Of course, we're best friends.
__Leonard Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula's coffin.
__Howard What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
__Amy Leonard, can I ask you a question?
__Howard Apparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.
__Sheldon Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I've failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
__Raj Dude, that's incredible!
__Bernadette I have to stay here for school.
__Howard That's what we're here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.
__Bernadette What do you say?
__ Well, good for you. Come on in.
__Penny Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
__Raj Hey, don't bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.
__Howard You're kidding.
__Leonard Coffee maker?
__Sheldon That's it. Prepare to be minimized.
__Howard What's going on?
__Leonard She hit on me.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard No, it's true.
__Leonard I didn't do it for the money!
__Howard Well, gotta go.
__Bernadette Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
__Howard I've got a better solution.
__Leonard Wait, wait. What?
__Howard Thanks.
__Howard Hey.
__Raj Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
__Bernadette I'm listening.
__Howard Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
__Amy It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one's best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.
__Leonard How come it's not a party when we do it here?
__Sheldon Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.
__Raj Okay, we've got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.
__Penny Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.
__Barry Weally? That's your question?
__Zack What's the difference?
__Raj Sheldon tells it better.
__Howard I think it's like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
__Raj Yes, it is. Very cool!
__Leonard No, no-no-no, I'm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that's not moving on, what is?
__Priya You need to cut the cord with Penny.
__Leonard No, no, I'm confident. It's not like I'm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I'll be the one saying it.
__Leonard Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
__Penny Then no.
__Leonard Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
__Sheldon And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.
__Priya You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.
__Leonard Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
__Sheldon Can we trust him?
__Penny You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.
__Bernadette Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm never speaking to Priya again.
__Leonard That's a relief.
__Howard New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D's, three O's.
__Howard Yeah, we're kind of bad-asses, aren't we?
__Raj It's a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
__Sheldon I always prefer the train.
__Penny Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.
__Penny All right. Hang on.
__Penny Well, then, good news. Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back.
__Greene You can think about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can't order the corresponding dish in column B. That's sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.
__Sheldon With what?
__Sheldon All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
__Penny Hey! How's it going?
__Leonard I didn't say Raj. Who said Raj?
__Dr Koothrappali So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?
__Dr Koothrappali Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that's not a bad way to go. He's Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don't drink a lot.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm back to trains. Woo-woo.
__Amy I don't understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
__Sheldon Did he mean as if she'd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?
__Leonard No. That's not what he meant.
__Amy Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
__Raj Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.
__Bernadette I will. I will!
__Sheldon Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
__Penny I felt sorry for him. Priya's giving him a hard time.
__Penny Hey, I know, let's take Sheldon dancing.
__Leonard Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
__Leonard This is ridiculous.
__Female Voice Self-destruct sequence aborted.
__Sheldon And…
__Leonard Very pretty.
__Leonard Well, it's not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
__Leonard I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
__Bernadette Bernadette (in Raj's bathroom): I think they're on to me. The story's starting to fall apart.
__Bernadette I know. But if she orders something low-fat I'll totally give her the full-fat version.
__Raj Hey! That's my sister and my country you're talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack about the other.
__Howard That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.
__Sheldon Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?
__Penny Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.
__Priya I'm sorry, did I miss something?
__Penny Yeah, tell me about it.
__Raj So you'd do a striptease?
__Penny Yeah, I know, right?
__Howard Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she's angry?
__Raj Really, ten miles? You're orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.
__Mrs Wolowitz Of course, he and I can play doctor!
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard Sorry. Does Sheldon know you're sleeping in here?
__Raj Did you sign this?
__Sheldon Remarkable. I'm just realizing how much Leonard's been skating by all these years.
__Penny What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
__Penny I screwed up. Leonard's a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
__Raj What's wrong with me, Penny?
__Sheldon Why?
__Leonard and Howard together What?
__Amy I'll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
__Raj Penny?
__Leonard Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
__Raj Sure, whatever.
__Leonard You're leaving?
__Penny You don't know the half of it.
__Actress Now, the H is for Her.
__Penny Shh! Here comes my joke.
__Sheldon When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
__Priya Fine.
__Sheldon You mean like Salt Lake City?
__Raj I'll try it. Like this?
__Penny No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
__Amy No, he didn't.
__Sheldon Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.
__Howard Why not? It's a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom's there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.
__Bernadette I'm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
__Amy If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.
__Amy Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They're kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
__Howard Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.
__Amy You're not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.
__Amy The hokey pokey is a young man's game.
__Penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
__Bernadette It's me.
__Sheldon Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.
__Howard Really? So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn't that a little on the nose?
__Sheldon Let's see what I'll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
__Sheldon Hamburgers and lemonade.
__Raj I worked on it all night. Use it.
__Sheldon No, you're wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich.
__Sheldon About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
__Howard Wow.
__Raj What? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
__Raj Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she's still with me. But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.
__Sheldon I don't know. If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I've long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?
__Sheldon Killing you? I can't breathe.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
__Stuart Here's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
__Sheldon Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.
__Penny Well, that, that's good. I'm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.
__Howard Right, right.
__Wil Look at what I wrote.
__Brent Eighteen.
__Sheldon The prospect of fried chicken.
__Raj No.
__Mrs Cooper And what do we do it with?  Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can't find someone, but there's a lock for every key. Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she'd never find a man, then one day, wouldn't ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, not crazy at all. And don't beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.
__Sheldon I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I'm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I've worked up a couple of Q's that will stump his sorry A.
__Sheldon What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
__Leonard Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?
__Mrs Cooper I am still going out with your friends.
__Leonard I hadn't…
__Sheldon I know, it filled in last year. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.
__Howard Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
__Alice Yeah. It's kinda based on my life.
__Penny It's okay.
__Leonard Oh, that's not who I am.
__Sheldon Oh, no! I can't!
__Leonard But I kind of have a girlfriend.
__Priya Oh, sounds serious. What's up?
__Priya A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.
__Amy Who didn't? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
__Amy Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.
__Amy It's just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.
__Penny No. All your little secrets are fine.
__Penny Yeah, we feel awful.
__Amy Oh, my gosh. No one's every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that's not true. Once, but then they all died.
__ Cut to Amy in a lilac dress.
__Leonard Really? Do we do that?
__Howard I'm pushing play.
__Penny I just eat the little crispy ones you don't like.
__Penny Oh.
__Penny So have you written anything I might have seen?
__Penny You should.
__Sheldon Yes. It's very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.
__Leonard Um, let's see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
__Leonard Don't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
__Leonard That's kind of between me and…
__Leonard Maybe I'm not done hanging out with…  You're right, it's getting late.
__Leonard I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I'm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry.
__Stuart Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
__Howard What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we're talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka'a?
__Raj I'll take one.
__Leonard I am not washed-up.
__Penny What's up?
__Sheldon In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
__Raj What's that one?
__Raj That's funny because those aren't the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Bernadette God, they're cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?
__Bernadette You know, i-it's just that I'm not that comfortable with little kids.
__Sheldon It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favour.
__Howard All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we're fine.
__Sheldon Trust me, we are not a couple.
__Penny You look beautiful.
__Bernadette Ooh!
__Bernadette Maybe.
__Bernadette Do you think you'll sleep with him tonight?
__Amy If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
__Sheldon It's in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.
__Leonard Uh, let's see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
__Penny Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don't even know what TJ stands for.
__Howard Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?
__Penny Okay, it's just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.
__Leonard What if I dump you?
__Leonard What?
__Leonard I don't want beef jerky.
__Bernadette Boy, I don't know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.
__Bernadette I'm a very vengeful person.
__Penny Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can't be together? Because you always have to be right.
__Penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don't miss the sex?
__Penny Yep.
__Raj You have a beautiful voice.
__Barry See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.
__Raj Hey, don't talk to her like that. She's a lady.
__Raj Can I pour you some wine? I think you'll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn't sure, but I didn't want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe's. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.
__Leonard Oh, no, come on!
__Raj Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‘Tombo' Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova' Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.
__Howard This is going right into my synagogue's newsletter.
__Sheldon Yeah, they have to, I'm a biter.
__Leonard Where do I sign?
__Sheldon Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.
__Leonard That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
__Mass Who's that?
__Howard No problem, Fruit Loops.
__Sheldon I said funny.
__Sheldon Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you're an expert.
__Raj Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.
__Amy No. But your thumb does.
__Sheldon I'm on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
__Amy Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
__Rothman Good evening.
__Siebert Gentlemen, I'm going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you're both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman's office, I couldn't give the furry crack of a rat's behind.
__ Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased by Kripke.
__Penny Bye.
__Penny No, come on, you're not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.
__Sheldon What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We're trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
__Penny Yeah, good call.
__Leonard What happened?
__Raj Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.
__Raj You could go to my guy. He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp. It's about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.
__Bernadette Hi, sweetie.
__Bernadette Cool. How do they do that?
__Nurse I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!
__Sheldon Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I'd give that a try.
__Sheldon Now that you're in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.
__Sheldon Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
__Penny Yes. On purpose.
__Leonard Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
__Bernadette I can't help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
__Together No!
__Lakshmi Impressive. What goes into making something like that.
__Sheldon I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.
__Howard Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette's or my mom's.
__Sheldon Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That's a lie.
__Howard Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.
__Howard Not on your life.
__Sheldon And you want me to return it for you?
__Sheldon Well, I can't help it. That's an involuntary twinkle.
__Sheldon I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
__Hawking Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.
__Raj He got us again.
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Sheldon Talk to the hand.
__Howard Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down.
__Penny Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.
__Sheldon A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
__Penny You're kidding.
__Bernadette I'll talk to him. He won't say no to his little girl.
__Leonard I guess we are. So, what's going on?
__Howard From nuts?
__Mr. Rostenkowski That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.
__Howard Um, okay.
__Mr. Rostenkowski You got a problem with that?
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette We'll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we'll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.
__Sheldon It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?
__Howard So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.
__Bernadette No.
__Mike Don't lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.
__Howard It's the groom.
__Raj Penny.
__Leonard Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don't?
__Howard I'm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it's all so unbelievable.
__Bernadette Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
__Howard Pretty clear.
__Penny Okay, hold on…
__Raj Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!
__Stuart I'm, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?
__Howard I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I'll talk to you tomorrow?
__Amy ‘Cause I've always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
__Bernadette It doesn't sound like it.
__Mike You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.
__Sheldon That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
__Sheldon The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we're going to be a faceless mass of six.
__Amy There might be a reason for that.
__Amy It's complicated.
__Amy Regardless, don't say anything to Leonard.
__Sheldon Thank you. I appreciate that. You're good people, Leonard. There's something I need to tell you.
__Leonard This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
__Bernadette Nope, this is my proud face.
__Howard Okay, I guess. It's just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.
__Howard Oh, baby, you're killing me.
__Sheldon That's a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.
__Leonard Smooth. Hi.
__Sheldon Notice people on your own time. We're working.
__Sheldon Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you're the tiebreaker.
__Mike What's that?
__Mike That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go.
__Howard Oh, I get it. They're waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don't worry, I can act surprised.
__Howard Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.
__Amy Uh, gift? Uh, Present!
__Penny Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
__Sheldon That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.
__Stuart Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Hmm.
__Leonard No, no. It's kind of crazy. I've never fooled around in the lab before.
__Amy I'm Raggedy Ann, and he's Raggedy C-3PO.
__Raj Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party?
__Howard No, I'm not. They're all being rude. And you're being rude.
__Howard Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
__Penny Really? You can't think of anyone weirder?
__Penny I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.
__Sheldon Really?
__Howard I can't sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.
__Leonard Maybe since you're so good, he's taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school…
__Penny Oh, wow, that's so sweet. Hey, what's this?
__Bernadette Good.
__Stephen Hawking Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.
__Wil Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you, but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.
__Amy You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
__Howard That's not true.
__Amy What?
__Sheldon Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.
__Penny Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
__Penny Sorry.
__Sheldon No, she won't. I'm great.
__Howard She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.
__Bernadette Aw, crap. Let's go.
__Howard Where we going?
__Bernadette Grab a box. We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.
__Howard Do you expect me to build this?
__Raj Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.
__Leonard Oh, great. We're still dating, right?
__Penny Nothing.
__Howard Should we follow him?
__Leonard This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
__Sheldon Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That's one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.
__Sheldon Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
__Leonard You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?
__Alex You sure? You're cute, you're funny. Maybe you're getting hit on, and you don't even know it.
__Raj That's good quality video.
__Raj That's called a fashion choice.
__Sheldon Oh, thank you.
__Penny Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
__Sheldon Get off there.
__Sheldon Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.
__Bernadette What can I tell ya? She's a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?
__Amy In Sheldon's spot.
__Bernadette You were parked in Howard's spot.
__Howard I'm warning you, Sheldon!
__Howard Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
__Howard You're the bigger man, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Sadly, yes. Amy's taking me to a memorial service. It's for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he'll never make his way back to China.
__Amy I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
__Sheldon Now you're being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.
__Bernadette So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
__Howard Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
__Sheldon Fine. Then I'm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
__Bernadette So you've just been lying to him?
__Amy All right. I'll tell him.
__Howard Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
__Sheldon Yeah, like a bunch of savages.
__Howard I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.
__Amy Geez, who's Forever 63 now?
__Penny Wow, you should come to girls' night more often. And not just because if you weren't here, this would be a can of Pabst.
__Raj What?
__Bernadette Think harder.
__Leonard No, it's nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.
__Leonard Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.
__Leonard She knows I have a girlfriend. It's so weird.
__Raj I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.
__Sheldon I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I'll be changing their names.
__Leonard Oh. It. Was.
__Sheldon Well, y-you, I-I'm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman's menstrual cycle…
__Alex Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
__Sheldon So to answer your question, no, it's not better.
__Penny All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
__Sheldon Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he's talking about. I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.
__Leonard What? Hey, hey! Come back here!
__Bernadette I don't know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!
__Penny Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?
__Raj If it's an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.
__Leonard Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I'll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.
__Howard Let me see.
__Leonard Yep.
__Sheldon So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That's hard cheese, Barry. You're one of the good ones.
__Howard Get that waste of money out of my face.
__Amy How's that?
__Leonard What did you do, put this in your tea?
__Kripke Don't pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.
__Kripke You have a girlfwiend.
__Kripke So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.
__Bernadette I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
__Bernadette No, here's how love works. You're gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?
__Penny Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
__Sheldon Of course.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Raj Aren't you gonna eat lunch?
__Sheldon I didn't notice.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Yeah, he does, but it's not the same.
__Leonard Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.
__Sheldon Um…
__Penny Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn't mean you don't care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you're not comfortable with, and that's fine.
__Raj Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.
__Bernadette If you could bend that far, you'd be doing us both a favour.
__Sheldon Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
__Sheldon Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
__Raj Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don't have dates?
__Leonard Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
__Howard Yes, please.
__Howard She hid my Xbox like I'm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don't give it back, I'm telling.
__Bernadette I've been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
__Leonard Two can play this game. Penny…
__Penny Get up.
__Stuart That does sound nice.
__Leonard This one does, and you're the reason why.
__Amy Happy Valentine's Day.
__Sheldon More than anything.
__Amy What's this?
__Stuart Great.
__Raj Later, losers!
__Penny Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you're all hunched like that, you're shutting the audience out, but when you're relaxed and open, you're inviting them in.
__Howard We're worried about you.
__Raj I was humiliated by yet another woman.
__Sheldon I know. I'm still learning to control it.
__Amy Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.
__Penny Okay. Do whatever you want.
__Howard Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
__Raj Oh.
__Girl Okay. Text me. Bye.
__Leonard She's pretty good, huh?
__Leonard She really is.
__Sheldon All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it's too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
__Raj Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?
__Bernadette Penny, what did you say?
__Raj I'm counting that as foreplay.
__Bernadette What if someone looks in there?
__Penny It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
__Penny What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?
__Bernadette Yeah, try doing it in heels.
__Bernadette That's more like it.
__Barry Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman's office was?
__Leonard Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.
__Sheldon Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
__Amy You don't say.
__Leonard Nurse's office.
__Sheldon Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.
__Leonard I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
__Leonard Way to hit 'em with both barrels.
__Raj Well, now it's biguous. What are you gonna do about it?
__Sheldon Um…
__Leonard No. We cannot lose to that jerk.
__Leonard Well…
__Amy And?
__Sheldon Do you have cufflinks?
__Leonard Where is he?
__Leonard Actually, he's a genius.
__Arthur You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children's science show?
__Sheldon Potato clock. Do potato clock.
__Leonard I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
__Paramedic No, that's not a rule. He can go.
__Bernadette Oh, thank God she's okay.
__Sheldon Name it.
__Arthur Yeah.
__Arthur What, Whatever.
__Sheldon Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I'm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I'm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I'm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.
__Raj That's great.
__Raj Why would you leave like that?
__Bernadette Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
__Amy Do you have any interest now?
__Leonard He knows, wow.
__Sheldon Well, that's the thing about factoids, they're interesting.
__Raj What the? Are you crazy? You can't talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
__Amy Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist. I think I'm a little more qualified than you to understand what's not working in your girlfriend's brain!
__Sheldon You know, I have to say, Penny, I don't understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.
__Sheldon How?
__Howard You're right, you're right. I'm really proud of you, and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone. And space beats water.
__Sheldon All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I'm not going to jail for you.
__Leonard Calm down. I'm getting out. I have something I want to give you.
__Amy Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.
__Raj All right.
__Everybody Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
__Penny Okay, you know what? I give up. I'm going to bed.
__Howard There wasn't. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?
__Penny Aaaaaaah!
__Sheldon Joke if you must, but you're going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.
__Leonard We finished the experiment early, so I thought I'd come home and surprise you.
__Stuart Yeah, just as well. It's a pretty rare piece. I'd rather just sell it to a real collector.
__Sheldon Oh.
__Penny Hey.
__Sheldon Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
__Sheldon Oh, I can take a look at it.
__Howard Hey.
__Howard You're kidding, right? I mean, you know I'm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
__Howard Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
__Bernadette That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had years of practice riding the dragon.
__Amy What happened?
__Penny What the hell?
__Leonard I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
__Sheldon Fine. Leonard, there's no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.
__Sheldon Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
__Sheldon I'd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
__Amy Really?
__ Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
__Penny Oh, that is so romantic.
__Bernadette Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom's?
__Howard Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.
__Sheldon She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.
__Leonard Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It's that sailor cap that you wanted. It's neat, huh?
__Sheldon Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
__Sheldon Hurts, doesn't it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you've ever told me is true.
__Sheldon I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
__Sheldon Maybe there's a third option.
__Raj Uh, can I just say, I've missed all of us hanging out together.
__Sheldon Come on.
__Penny Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
__Leonard Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there's no hard feelings.
__Bernadette I knew it, we're gonna lose.
__Sheldon Because you've been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
__Penny That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
__Raj Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
__Penny Yeah. It's on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
__Penny I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's make-up and wears balloon boobies.
__Leonard That sounds nice. Yeah.
__Sheldon April 13, a dark night, indeed.
__Sheldon Fine. I'm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.
__Sheldon Yes. But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He's a cat. He doesn't have a job.
__Penny How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
__Sheldon Really?
__Sheldon Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won't be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we'll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.
__Sheldon Why? So you can see the look on Amy's face when she hears my top-notch idea?
__Bernadette Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
__Raj As you wish.
__Raj Amy.
__Amy Image number six, woman giving birth.
__Bernadette I may have overreacted.
__Howard Look, she's gonna be back any second, so here's the deal. I'm writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.
__Raj That is so beautiful.
__Leonard Well, for starters, you've broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?
__Penny I can name tons.
__Leonard Nope, it was better before.
__Amy I don't think the Smithsonian's gonna want your marker.
__Raj Wait, I don't understand. They didn't find the element?
__Raj Oh, that's a big deal.
__Amy Sheldon, I've been thinking about it, and you're right. You don't deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I'm embarrassed for you.
__Howard Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You're my best friend and my lover. We're like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can't have one without the other. I couldn't have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.
__Leonard Stop it, you're gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
__Penny Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you'll see why.
__Sheldon Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.
__Amy Can't talk, in the zone.
__Leonard That's because you've never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
__Sheldon This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
__Amy Yes, and I've heard so much about you. Hey look, we're wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.
__Arthur Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?
__Arthur I wasn't going to tell you.
__Raj Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.
__Raj Penny, how's it going over there?
__Arthur That's what I told my lawyers.
__Arthur What, what is it?
__Leonard You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he's a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.
__Sheldon Oh, wait here. I'll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye's house. As long as I'm not within 500 feet of it.
__Leonard How about that? Sheldon's being reasonable.
__Sheldon How about this? I promise I won't pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That's a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.
__Sheldon Put it on. Let's share the experience.
__Bernadette If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?
__Sheldon There's nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don't Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.
__Sheldon Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.
__Penny But it didn't seem real.
__Sheldon Yes, Miss Amy.
__Leonard Well, a goof or not, you're actually married. You need to get this taken care of.
__Amy It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
__Bernadette I'll help Raj in here. Why don't you go keep my dad company?
__Leonard Why are you mad at me? You're the one that did the stupid thing. I'm just trying to fix it.
__Leonard Sure.
__Howard That's why I sit.
__Leonard That is not true.
__Leonard Yeah, well, she's not gonna be your wife for long.
__Mrs Wolowitz Did somebody say pie?
__Sheldon Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?
__Zack Don't be. It's my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
__Leonard Of course you're not. People love trained monkeys.
__Sheldon Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
__Sheldon Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
__Raj Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.
__Sheldon No, no, of course you have to publish. That's your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
__Barry I'm sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.
__Bernadette What is wrong with you?
__Penny Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
__Penny Yeah, which means we don't have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.
__Stuart Oh, good, I'm glad you guys didn't wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it's, it's seven, but that's fine.
__ Fantasy sequence in the Cheesecake Factory.
__Amy Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?
__Mrs Cooper Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.
__Bernadette Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
__Mrs Wolowitz That's it? There's not enough food.
__Stuart I just wanted to be in anyone's story.
__Amy I am in the mix. And I'm the hottest one.
__Sheldon Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.
__Leonard It's a joke.
__Howard If you're so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.
__Raj That depends. On any level, do you think she's hot?
__Penny Are you serious? For what?
__Leonard Um…
__Penny Did you seriously just say um?
__Security Guard It's all right.
__Raj Okay, nice talking to you.
__Leonard I don't know.
__Leonard Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.
__Amy Why? Because Sheldon's not here this week, and you don't think I have any other options? I'm just kidding. I'll get my purse.
__Raj He brought you a pretty rock.
__Voice And out.
__Penny Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can't Leonard understand it?
__Sheldon Because he's not like us, Penny. We're dreamers.
__Bert Yeah.
__Jesse Sorry. You want the book or not?
__Raj He'll be so upset. He'll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
__Penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
__Sheldon I'm willing to if you guys are.
__Howard It's been ten minutes. We're running out of time.
__Leonard I did it, I did it, I'm in the queue.
__Leonard Did you tell them that you're holding your convention at a Marie Callender's, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?
__Howard What do you mean?
__Penny Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
__Leonard Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.
__Raj Uh, maybe it'll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?
__Howard I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.
__Penny A whole box.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Sheldon What?
__Man In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.
__Man Hold on to your conductor's hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.
__Sheldon I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?
__Raj Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?
__Leonard How's she doing?
__Raj Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
__Raj Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.
__Penny All right, sweetie, you're paying for this table, and it's your apartment, too.
__Penny That's not what I'm saying.
__Howard What's going on?
__Bernadette Maybe you should have a seat.
__Howard Hi, Ma. How are you?
__Raj I don't appreciate your sarcasm, but we've still got two blocks to go, so I'll put up with it.
__Raj What? You've kissed, like, once in three years.
__Amy Well, what would I say to her?
__Amy I have.
__Penny Yeah. Why wouldn't I want to get my old job back? It'll be fun to see everyone. I haven't talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let's just get this over with.
__Amy Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
__Penny I wouldn't be so sure about that.
__Bernadette Well, I told Howie if I wasn't busy, I'd spend the night at his mom's. So for God's sake, think of something.
__Raj You can't leave. You're a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
__Howard Oh, boy.
__Amy What's it for?
__Raj Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?
__Sheldon But if we show up and you're holding them, she'll think they're only from you.
__Leonard Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful?
__Sheldon That's ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
__Penny That's so sweet.
__Sheldon No. I'm not sure how we're going to get past this.
__Howard Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
__Sheldon Well, someone has to.
__Amy Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.
__Amy Included?
__Penny Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
__Leonard What does your agent think?
__Amy Uh, it's date night. Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?
__Leonard So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?
__Penny That's what I'm afraid of.
__Emily Thanks. I love that jacket.
__Emily I don't understand.
__Store assistant You'll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.
__Penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
__Howard Ugh. Me, too. What happened?
__Howard I wouldn't worry about it. He's got a pretty good sense of humour.
__Penny Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.
__Raj I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
__Raj Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard. Help me get out of the tub.
__Penny I haven't been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
__Howard And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
__Leonard Ah, it's Penny.
__Amy Because she has sex with you.
__Amy Really? What did you do?
__Penny Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.
__Sheldon Professor Proton is dead?
__Sheldon Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
__Amy I wonder why that is.
__Penny No, I'm dry. You're a big crybaby, you start, I'll join in.
__Leonard I got your back.
__Raj Ugh, let's get this over with.
__Sheldon You must be here to give me advice.
__Penny No, I meant that as a regret.
__Penny And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
__Leonard I don't know what you're upset about. I'm the one who's losing.
__Amy Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.
__Sheldon That's true. Oh, it's a good thing I had a nap.
__Mrs Wolowitz I get plenty of exercise.
__Penny Thanks. There's no reason why I shouldn't be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone's ever seen.
__Wil I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.
__Sheldon Slick, huh?
__Bernadette Queen? I've been killing myself here.
__Raj Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.
__Penny What? No, that's not what I'm saying.
__Penny What does it matter? The point is, I'm choosing you.
__Bernadette She's just so impossible, they keep quitting.
__Howard I don't know what else we can do.
__Mrs Hofstadter Would you like for you and me to talk more?
__Amy Atomic magnets?
__Sheldon Where are you going to go?
__Amy You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you're always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.
__Penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
__Sheldon What happened?
__Howard Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
__Bernadette So, she's not too much for you?
__Howard No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Raj But half-man, half-owl could fly…
__Bernadette Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
__Mrs Davis Currently, you're being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you'll be able to choose whatever field of research you'd like.
__Penny Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won't stop bugging me.
__Amy Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
__Sheldon No one signed up.
__Sheldon Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?
__Sheldon You take that back.
__Sheldon Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
__Howard Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.
__Howard Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me.
__Penny Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.
__Leonard Fine. We'll take it right now.
__Howard Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?
__Howard Thank you. Thank you.
__Howard Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?
__Leonard It's not that bad.
__Raj Great.
__Sheldon Yeah, he's right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.
__Sheldon No.
__Raj Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?
__Emily All right, night.
__Leonard Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.
__Sheldon Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you're having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?
__Raj Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.
__Sheldon I'm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
__Penny Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Is that a no?
__Howard Also mine.
__Leonard Okay, let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.
__Penny Oh. Okay.
__Penny No.
__ Shortly afterwards.
__Amy Can you believe this nerd?
__Leonard So you're, you're saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?
__Bernadette Have you ever seen a body so fine?
__Leonard Yeah, it'll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.
__Raj Yup.
__Leonard Hmm.
__Penny Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn't make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.
__Leonard I want you to know I get why you don't want the money, you've got this new job, you're excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.
__Sheldon Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.
__Bernadette How much, Howie?
__Sheldon Well, I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.
__Sheldon We'll take some Funyuns.
__Sheldon That's humorous.
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Thank you. Sorry.
__Bernadette No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.
__Raj Oh, cool.
__Leonard Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.
__Leonard I'll be right back.
__Leonard Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.
__Dr Lorvis She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.
__Dr Lorvis Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.
__Penny Okay. Nope. That's it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.
__Penny Move it.
__Howard Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.
__Sheldon All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
__Bernadette My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me 'cause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.
__Raj How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
__Sheldon We pretend we're aliens. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
__Sheldon My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.
__Penny You're kidding.
__Sheldon Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren't elected. It's gonna be off the hook.
__Sheldon Excuse me.
__Howard Do you like her because you both have red hair?
__Emily Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?
__Leonard I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
__Howard You don't look okay.
__Amy I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.
__Sheldon Amy, he's my best friend, and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.
__Sheldon Is he okay?
__Sheldon That's a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
__Bernadette Oh. Howie, be serious.
__Bernadette Who were you in couples therapy with?
__Raj I don't know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
__Howard Mmm. It's just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
__Howard Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
__Prof Sharpe It's the number of calories in a yoghurt. That's his food diary.
__Penny Oh, come on, they don't hate you, all right? They're just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.
__Amy Take that, glass ceiling.
__Leonard Sheldon, that wasn't for you.
__Howard How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
__Bernadette Then you're both sad?
__Leonard I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
__Santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
__Leonard I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
__Penny Of course it is.
__Penny Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?
__Bernadette What's he talking about?
__Leonard Ah, interesting, we're being accused of making you do things you don't like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.
__Sheldon Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.
__Sheldon You know what? You think you're so tolerant, but the truth is you're mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.
__Sheldon Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.
__Leonard Buddy.
__Amy Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.
__Penny Yeah, have fun.
__Howard Hold on. What's in it for us?
__Sheldon And his last meal was a food pellet? You're a monster.
__Howard Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn't want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you're so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.
__Leonard So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
__Leonard Howard's right, that'll never work.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, then do it.
__Penny Come in.
__Howard I don't know, he's not really hurting anybody.
__Sheldon For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you're still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
__Leonard One, two three.
__Raj What does it say?
__Doctor Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?
__Leonard Read it back one more time.
__Sheldon My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
__Amy No.
__Amy In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
__Cooper Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it's a little nippy.
__Barry Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper's onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.
__Amy I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.
__Stuart I think that's a good idea. Take him out of my store.
__Penny Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
__Sheldon Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you're holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that'll make the next part really hard.
__Howard That is a good point. But I didn't marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I'm being.
__Leonard That would be great.
__Raj Don't say that. I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench, but you're pretty great.
__Sheldon I can't. I'm naked.
__Sheldon Hang on.
__Amy Oh, hey.
__Raj Thanks.
__Raj And you're eating alone at a deli. I don't buy it, you're not him.
__Howard I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.
__Amy And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.
__Leonard Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
__Bernadette Just drop it.
__Sheldon That's it?
__Penny Sheldon.
__Zombie Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!
__Howard I could've driven her.
__Bernadette Oh, no. That thing's gonna end up in my bedroom.
__Penny You ready?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Emily Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.
__Raj Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I'm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?
__Howard Why were you looking in it?
__Howard In Emily's eyes.
__Amy He might not be.
__Howard It's all defrosting.
__Leonard What are we doing?
__Leonard If you're trying to make me feel better, it's not working.
__Howard Okay.
__Amy Do you need any help in the kitchen?
__Raj Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.
__Sheldon Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned.
__Leonard No, it's okay. We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
__Sheldon She said my name first, that must kill you.
__Sheldon Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.
__Amy Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.
__Sheldon You're blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
__Howard Don't listen to her. You and I go way back, we're like brothers.
__Sheldon So, what are you in for?
__Nerdy Guy Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.
__Amy No, Sheldon.
__Wil You know, I'm in the movie, too.
__Leonard I don't think you can do both.
__Raj A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?
__Leonard Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
__Howard You are my brother.
__Penny Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it is the person who asks.
__Leonard All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
__Penny Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
__Second Girl They're gonna love you. I heard she's pushing 40 and everything's fake.
__Howard The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
__Howard Sheldon.
__Howard Oh. All right, playtime's over. Let's open this baby up.
__Penny Yeah.
__Howard It worked fine, it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.
__Leonard Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.
__Leonard They're graduating.
__Sheldon Of course not. I love you. I'm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say.
__Dr Hofstadter Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.
__Leonard Subtle, mom, real subtle.
__Stuart Morning.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.
__Raj We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.
__Penny Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.
__Sheldon Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
__Dr Hofstadter It means, I can't believe we're having this conversation.
__Howard That's not the same thing. Emily's a person. Stuart's more like an infestation, something you spray for.
__Penny Yeah, you've been going out for years. You haven't even slept together.
__Penny So busy.
__Howard I didn't touch it. Must have been Stuart.
__Howard Agreed. When he gets home, I'm dropping the hammer.
__Penny Well, you want a date, pick a date.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.
__Bernadette Don't let that sway you.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard This is it.
__Mrs Cooper Well, let's not be hasty. Are you sure it's over for good?
__Howard Everything's gonna be okay.
__Penny Oh. That's so sweet of you.
__Sheldon Mandy Chao?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny You couldn't sleep either?
__Sheldon I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend's marriage.
__Amy You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?
__Amy Good-bye.
__Sheldon Oh, of course. Wouldn't want to intrude. This is yours.
__Leonard Wake up, wake up, wake up.
__Penny What do you think?
__Amy Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.
__Leonard I've been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why.
__Leonard Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
__Amy I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
__Sheldon It runs on syphilis?
__Penny Hey.
__Bernadette Speaking of Sheldon, how's single life treating you?
__Sheldon I usually don't put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.
__Penny Fine, you want me to call? I'll call. Why am I so nervous?
__Penny's Dad Penny' Oh, ten, twelve months ago.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Well, apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.
__Caption Exothermic Reaction.
__Bernadette Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.
__Sheldon Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem.
__Bernadette Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.
__Amy Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky, but he's also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.
__Raj Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?
__Raj She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
__Leonard It's indoors, so no sunscreen.
__Leonard I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg. They're both pretty submissive.
__Amy Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.
__Bernadette What did he say?
__Penny Well, what are you gonna do?
__Sheldon But you won't need much for that.
__Raj Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.
__Sheldon I'm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
__Sheldon Well, he is. I'm a wedding planner who can't find love himself. It's ironic, but the point is we can't trust you. You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.
__Man Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.
__Raj That's a fair point. We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.
__Leonard And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?
__Leonard Thank you.
__Sheldon You're taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
__Leonard He wants more money.
__Amy It's going fine. It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
__Barry But you have to add my name to your paper.
__Leonard You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.
__Sheldon Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
__Bernadette Then how 'bout the bathroom?
__Bernadette Great. I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.
__Leonard There's a security camera?
__Sheldon Yeah. You don't have to tell me.
__Howard Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
__Wil Wil won't.
__Howard I don't know why she's lying to you. She's the one who doesn't want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy Okay. But I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
__Amy Do you have any heels higher than this? He's pretty tall.
__Howard I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.
__Penny Yeah.
__Dave Oh, that's too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?
__Dave No, but I've followed his work for years. He's a rock star. You've got to tell me about him. What's he like?
__Sheldon I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.
__Leonard Yeah, poor us.
__Sheldon Well, Howard, what about you?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Baby.
__Leonard Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
__Sheldon Hey, let's not pull at that thread. Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other. Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends. Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.
__Sheldon I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.  My country, 'tis of thee. No.
__Leonard It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.
__Raj That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
__Dave Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.
__Leonard Aw.
__Sheldon Well, I'll let you get back to your date.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's, they make a fuss. I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.
__Penny Okay, well, what's the third option?
__Stuart My, uh, my doctor's worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?
__Penny Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.
__Amy You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
__Penny Have fun, guys.
__Raj Oh, did you hear from Wil?
__Sheldon All right. Hello.
__Amy I'm just, um, really nervous.
__Amy Okay.
__Wil Although, we all remember Jar Jar.
__Sheldon I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
__Sheldon Mm, that's a great question. I like when they're next to a Chipotle.
__Sheldon Kind of a wuss.
__Stuart Can I come in?
__Howard What?
__Dr Gallo Ah, it's my pleasure. I'm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?
__Dr Gallo Sounds like you're holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.
__Bernadette I guess so.
__Bernadette Sure he does. Well, let us know when you're all settled in.
__Howard Oh. He was so excited.
__Bernadette Hmm. Maybe he's busy.
__Howard Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
__Bernadette And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.
__Sheldon Nah, you're right, that's dumb.
__Penny I just meant a question about the drug.
__Dr Gallo Hmm.
__Penny And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
__Amy Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.
__Raj I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.
__Sheldon I can't believe you're not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
__Sheldon Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
__Raj Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
__Emily Why are you defending him?
__Leonard They're not going on the trip.
__Raj You went to Emily's to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.
__Sheldon That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
__Penny Is she okay?
__Bernadette This is so cool.
__Emily Oh, it's okay, Sheldon. Come with us.
__Sheldon That's me. Bye, Stuart.
__Sheldon And that's not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I'll see where she is.
__Leonard Can you please live with us forever?
__Howard Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.
__Amy I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.
__Howard Really? So it's okay if I fl…
__Claire Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.
__Claire Great. I'll text you.
__Bernadette Are you gonna tell Emily?
__Meemaw Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.
__Leonard Not really.
__Penny I don't know. I'm, I'm gonna flirt with him.
__Penny Because I'm young. Let's go.
__Howard How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
__Leonard That sounds fun. When's it start?
__Penny Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.
__Bernadette Oh, terrific.
__Sheldon All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.
__Amy This is so exciting.
__Leonard Hey, you know what we should do?
__Leonard Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
__Howard I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.
__Sheldon This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
__Leonard You may have actually just come up with something.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
__Amy Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
__Howard If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny Oh, my God.
__Sheldon Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.
__All Happy birthday!
__Penny Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what's going on?
__Penny Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.
__Leonard Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.
__Howard See, he's not wearing a tie.
__Sheldon That's great.
__Amy What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
__Howard I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
__Leonard Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard's invention, Sheldon's math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.
__Howard Is the foetus helping you? ‘Cause that's cheating.
__Claire Uh, I'm almost off work. What are you doing now?
__Claire Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to any more?
__Sheldon Oh, but I like this computer.
__Leonard Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.
__Penny You were home alone and had no one to play with?
__Penny Penny (at Howard's workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
__Sheldon Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.
__Amy It's okay, Sheldon. You know, I've saved a lot of weird things, too.
__Howard Yeah. Anywhere you want.
__Sheldon Well, how would I know?
__Raj No, no, you're pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.
__Sheldon Thanks.
__Leonard Why are you so mean to me?
__Bernadette Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.
__Leonard You'll wish it would kill you.
__Sheldon Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.
__Amy Ooh, that sounds cozy.
__Bernadette And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.
__Amy She's trying to think of something she's never done before. This could take a while.
__Sheldon So I drink.
__Howard Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
__Howard I'll go get him.
__Howard Hey, look at that. It's weird again.
__Bernadette Isn't that the best?
__Sheldon Oh, I haven't asked it yet.
__Sheldon You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
__Howard I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
__Penny Really? The only adult?
__Sheldon Oh, it's just a meeting. One simple meeting.
__Howard There you go again.
__Howard No, I'm fine.
__Howard And I'm gonna eat it all.
__Howard Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.
__Penny Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
__Howard Well just a feeling.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Amy And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
__Leonard Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.
__Leonard I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
__Penny No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
__Leonard We're leaving now!
__Howard You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.
__Leonard Oh, so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?
__Penny Oh, yeah.
__Amy Are you gonna say hi to him?
__Raj I said no questions.
__Raj We're just keeping it casual.
__Zack What are you talking about?
__Raj Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.
__Zack Anything for you, my little foreign friend.
__Leonard That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.
__Sheldon You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.
__Howard If you really care that much, there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.
__Penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
__Penny Oh. Sorry. Didn't know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
__Amy I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
__Sheldon Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.
__Beverly Oh, what are you currently developing?
__Sheldon They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?
__Penny It was spur of the moment.
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette Who's going to officiate?
__Amy Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honour?
__Sheldon You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.
__Amy You've met her, right?
__Mary Yes, I have.
__Leonard And his girlfriend, Amy.
__Alfred A pleasure.
__Mary I'm sorry.
__Raj I also love the enemies of America.
__Amy Play with your phone.
__Alfred Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.
__Mary I don't have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that's very interesting.
__Mary Really?
__Bernadette Do not pull over. I'm not raising this baby alone.
__Sheldon See, that's funny because…
__Beverley Penny, wait.
__Beverley Stop it, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.
__Raj May I ask what this is about?
__Susan Susan (Penny's mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?
__Beverley Thank you.
__Beverley Morning.
__Penny I thought it was really funny.
__Alfred Maybe we meet halfway.
__Wyatt Hey, there he is.
__Mary Oh, so am I.
__Susan Um, Randall's in between jobs.
__Beverley Do the world a favour, and don't wake up tomorrow morning.
__Leonard You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.
__Amy What's wrong?
__Howard Oh. Well, hey, me, too.
__Colonel Williams Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.
__Amy I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
__Penny You threatened to sue?
__Sheldon Impressive.
__Sheldon And look how irritable it's making you!
__Raj Oh, I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?
__Raj You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.
__Penny How early are we?
__Bernadette Does it really need one?
__Penny That's me, I'm her. You know, he didn't trick me, he just wore me down.
__Dr Koothrapalli Of course. What seems to be the trouble?
__Sheldon He said start with it, not end with it.
__Amy So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?
__Leonard Just nod and smile. He's almost gone.
__Sheldon Leonard, please, let me go.
__Bernadette I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
__Penny Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
__Penny Didn't.
__Howard Is that the hot tub?
__Leonard Yeah. My record was six.
__Stuart What are you doing here?
__Bernadette What?
__Sheldon Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women.
__Raj Actually, I'm single now.
__Sheldon I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.
__Amy Well, that's so nice. Who's coming?
__Raj Wait till you see the crib we found.
__Stuart So, what did I miss?
__Leonard No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
__Sheldon No, I mean it. I mean it. It's like you have the soul of a label maker.
__Sheldon You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
__Sheldon Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.
__Howard So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?
__Sheldon Interesting. Very interesting.
__ s
__Penny Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
__Penny Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife and your own eyes over me? Wow.
__Leonard And?
__Leonard Yeah? What are you keeping?
__Isabella You're kidding.
__Sheldon Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.
__Leonard Yeah, good for you.
__Sheldon I hope you're happy making me read this. Bert's work is remarkable, and I'm more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.
__Leonard Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life.
__Howard All right, we're done. It's offensive.
__Sheldon I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
__Leonard Do not tell Wolowitz.
__Penny Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.
__Stuart And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.
__Howard Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.
__Leonard Well, now they're yours.
__Sheldon But you don't even like flags.
__Leonard Yeah, I like this one.
__Sheldon But I designed it.
__Howard It's like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.
__Penny Are you sure?
__Leonard You're good at revenge, how do we get him back?
__Sheldon All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn.
__Bernadette Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.
__Stuart I'll give him a call. We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.
__Strange old man Hey, how you doing?
__Sheldon My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.
__Theodore Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank. I'm O-negative.
__Stuart Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.
__Sheldon This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.
__Amy Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
__Bernadette I know.
__Stuart Howard went to space.
__Penny Anyone else want to try?
__Sheldon Some will be successful, some may be homeless. It's fun to think about.
__Leonard Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don't you maniacs own a calendar?
__Amy Maybe there won't be one.
__Amy Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
__Leonard And their Sherpas.
__Howard What did we miss?
__Sheldon To this day I've never touched Stuart.
__Sheldon What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
__Penny So things started to turn around?
__Leonard What's that supposed to mean?
__Leonard No, no, no, no, let's talk about it. I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
__Amy I'll miss you.
__Sheldon Well, what can we do to cheer you up?
__Sheldon Hmm. Yeah, you're right. It's like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now I'm just like, eh.
__Raj Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down.
__ once you get the hang of it. Step. Step. Hop onto Ottoman.
__Raj Hold on, I don't think she was impressed.
__Penny Do you really think that's funny?
__Penny I think this all looks good.
