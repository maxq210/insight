__Leonard See you.
__Leonard Should we have invited her for lunch?
__Leonard Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
__Leonard Sheldon, sit!
__Howard It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.
__ What do you think their combined IQ is?
__Sheldon From the intercom.
__Penny I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.
__Penny I'm just going to go wash up.
__Leonard When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.
__Penny Hey guys.
__Sheldon If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.
__Penny You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
__ Raj
__Leonard What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
__Howard These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
__Penny Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.
__Leonard Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
__Sheldon Lock and load.
__Howard There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I'm… a bit of a self-taught expert.
__Leonard Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.
__Leonard There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.
__Sheldon But I thought you wanted to cancel?
__Penny How?
__Leonard No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.
__Leonard Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?
__Leonard Well then we'll avoid Finkleday, we'll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
__Sheldon Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
__Sheldon Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
__Penny Well, yeah.
__Penny No, I mean what you find enjoyable.
__Sheldon I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?
__Mrs Cooper Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon.
__Mrs Cooper But intelligently designed by a creator, right?
__Mrs Cooper I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”
__Sheldon Dr Gablehouser.
__Sheldon Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
__Leonard I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.
__Penny Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?
__Sheldon You're a lucky man, Leonard.
__Lesley Yeah, I'm good to go.
__ I'm good, I'm good to go.
__Penny Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.
__Penny We really shouldn't be standing here.
__Leonard You don't believe in luck.
__Leonard Sheldon, let it go.
__Penny As usual, I'm not following.
__Sheldon What about comic-books?
__Raj What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.
__Raj Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.
__Sheldon See, people get it.
__Leonard Where do you get this stuff?
__Leonard Go on.
__Girl I still don't get it.
__Penny I'm so sorry about what happened.
__Leonard How much have you had to drink tonight?
__Leonard Probably.
__Sheldon Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.
__Penny As usual, nice talking to you Raj
__Sheldon Well she could have said goodbye.
__Sheldon So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.
__Christie Hi, Christie.
__Sheldon He's putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, that's punishable by death.
__Leonard Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.
__Leonard Who are you calling?
__Raj Okay, that's my life, that's my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.
__Mrs Koothrappali Lalita's parents approve the match.
__Leonard I'm done, anybody else?
__Sheldon A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
__Leonard Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?
__Leonard What happened?
__Sheldon You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.
__Sheldon What did I do?
__Raj Please wait until I get into the hall.
__Leonard Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.
__Leonard It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
__Leonard Forget the parties.
__Leonard Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put's fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy!”
__Leonard Oh.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?
__Penny Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard…
__Penny Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.
__Leonard I don't know, I wasn't choosing my…
__Penny Bye Sheldon.
__Leonard Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he's worse.
__Leonard Stop it.
__Sheldon Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.
__Leonard So?
__Leonard What?
__Leonard What was I supposed to say.
__ Leonard closes door.
__Leonard Un-unravelable?
__Howard Wow.
__Penny Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.
__Howard Yeah, uh, break a leg.
__Sheldon It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
__Leonard Who are you?
__Leonard Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?
__Sheldon What?
__ Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!
__Leonard Drink whatever you want.
__Leonard Affirmative, with fever.
__Howard Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?
__Penny And there was no-one there to take care of you?
__Sheldon Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”
__Penny Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.
__Penny Little ball of fur.
__Sheldon Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.
__Leonard How about that.
__Dr Gablehouser Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.
__Dennis I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.
__Penny You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?
__Sheldon What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I've never really paid attention.
__Howard Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Leonard It's take your daughter to work day.
__Howard Wow, I almost didn't recognise him.
__Howard Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
__Penny Zod?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
__Penny Yeah, and the bag it came in.
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?
__Leonard Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I…
__Howard Sheldon.
__Leonard No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.
__Gablehouser Correct.
__Gablehouser Ten seconds.  PMS.
__Sheldon Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist.  Ow!
__Leonard Where are your snipers?
__Penny Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.
__Howard Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.
__Leonard What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
__Howard You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.
__Leonard Not for long.
__Raj None of your business. Take it or leave it.
__Penny What the hell's going on?
__Penny No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.
__Leonard It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?
__Howard Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and… BAM! (shakes girl's hand) Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you've already met Howard.
__Howard Yeah.
__Howard Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.
__Howard Come on, Shelly, she's family.
__Missy Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there's a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.
__Howard Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?
__Leonard Those are not mine.
__Missy Go on.
__ What do you want, Howard?
__Sheldon Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.
__Penny Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?
__Howard Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.
__Penny Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Alright, let's go.
__Penny Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny Okay, so we're getting this one?
__Nurse Get out of my ER.
__Penny Yeah, well so do I, look you've got to stall Leonard a little longer.
__Howard You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Howard Not now, I have a blog to find.
__Howard Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.
__Leonard I'm her friend, I'm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.
__Penny I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.
__Leonard Aw, good for me. Where are you going?
__Raj Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
__Penny I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.
__Penny Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.
__Sheldon Okay. I think this will be my seat.
__Penny Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.
__Leonard No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
__Howard Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?
__Leonard That's not a bad sign.
__Penny No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?
__Sheldon You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Leonard What's going on with you?
__Penny Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you're just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
__Leonard I didn't do anything, he's just gone insane.
__Voice Strippergram.
__Leonard What secret. Tell me the secret.
__Sheldon I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows.
__Penny He told you?
__Leonard That doesn't matter to me at all.
__Howard I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.
__Howard Hello.
__Sheldon Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.
__Sheldon Alone?
__Sheldon I don't care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
__Penny Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
__Sheldon Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
__Penny Thankyou, Sheldon.
__Sheldon There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
__Sheldon AFK. Away from keyboard.
__Sheldon Danger, danger.
__Leslie Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.
__Sheldon Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
__Sheldon Drink a healing potion.
__Howard That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  I'm not necessarily talking to the food.
__Raj Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.
__Sheldon Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?
__Sheldon Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.
__Raj Speaking of untouchables, I've got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.
__Penny What are you guys talking about?
__Raj and Penny together Thank you.
__Howard Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.
__Howard So, not a puppy?
__Sheldon But how am I going to get to work?
__Sheldon All right. Hmm, huh, I'm sorry, I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.
__Howard No, just for the fun of it, I'm gonna take his side.
__Sheldon And Radio Shack.
__Howard The application in your hand, give it to her.
__DMV Lady Look at that sign up there.
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Booting.
__Howard What?
__Leonard Okay, fasten your seat belt.
__Sheldon No, no. Leonard, I'm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it's safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.
__Howard Really? Why?
__Leonard Yep
__Howard Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station's Liquid Waste Disposal System.
__Ramona Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.
__Sheldon Oh, great. She's smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.
__Penny Um, sure, sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker.
__Sheldon Just one more bite.
__Howard Oh, look, the's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, that's the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. It's the future Mrs. Wolowitz.
__Howard Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
__Howard House? What house?
__Sheldon Did you protest?
__Penny I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?
__Howard One of us, one of us.
__Sheldon Why?
__Howard No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.
__Leonard Thanks a lot, Howard.
__Sheldon It's Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
__Leonard Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
__Leonard All right, I really didn't want to do this, but… here.
__Sheldon Ooh, I don't think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.
__Howard A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like “Normally, I'm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.” I've got a whole list of 'em. Who wants to be my wingman?
__Howard Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair?
__Woman Howard, is everything okay?
__Howard OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.
__Sheldon Leonard is going to  the office.
__ Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
__Howard Lisa?
__Steph Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.
__Penny Yeah, Leonard told me.
__Leonard Oh, my god, what did you do?
__Sheldon You don't see it, do you? We're losing her.
__Sheldon Yes, I'm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?
__Raj Yeah.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.
__Sheldon No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it.
__Leonard Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
__Sheldon Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.
__Howard Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.
__Sheldon You're welcome, Leonard.
__Leonard Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
__Sheldon My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.
__Leonard Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
__Penny You had sex, didn't you?
__Leonard Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here's the thing, I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.
__Howard What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
__Howard Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
__Sheldon So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
__Leonard Actually, he's pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
__Raj Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.
__Penny Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?
__David All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.
__Leonard Lactose.
__Penny Smoother than you.
__Sheldon I should note I'm having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.
__Penny Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
__Howard People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
__Howard You really think so?
__Sheldon What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot's massive size and its overwhelming power.
__Sheldon Never. I'd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
__Sheldon Do it.
__Leonard Go, go, go, go!
__Howard Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.
__Leonard Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
__Sheldon Too bad. If it'd been a friend, I'm available to fill the void.  It's just as well, she smelled like moth balls.
__Raj Stu the cockatoo?
__Leonard He had Lysine but changed it.
__Kripke No, that's wong. There's an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.
__Leonard Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
__Sheldon Don't you need money?
__Penny But what if you need it?
__Sheldon Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn't sure.
__Howard Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?
__Penny Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
__Leonard It's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here's something, if you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
__Howard What is it?
__Leonard I could use some help.
__Leonard No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
__Sheldon That's your badge of honour, your warrior's wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.
__Beverley You'll have to be more specific.
__Penny What do you mean why?
__Sheldon That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
__Beverley Well, it's all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.
__Beverley Oh, well, I've been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.
__Leonard Oh, my God. What happened?
__Leonard Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.
__Leonard There's no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon You went to the comic book store without me.7
__Penny Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go. Your mother told me.
__Penny Hello, Sheldon.
__Penny Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
__Howard's Mother Howard' Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!
__Howard I'll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.
__Leslie ‘Cause then we'd be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.
__Sheldon Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
__Sheldon What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
__Sheldon I still don't like this cushion.
__Leslie Surrender, then Denny's.
__Sheldon We're not flying, we're taking the train.
__Sheldon Don' we're taking the train!
__Sheldon Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that's Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don't kill me! I'm pro-robot! Ahh!
__Howard You're overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she's willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.
__Raj Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
__Leonard Right. Of course.
__Leonard I don't know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.
__Summer Is that so?
__Leonard Excuse me.  Okay, I'll be honest with you. I've just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you're a human being; I'm a human being. I could just say to you…
__Penny Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
__Sheldon Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.
__Sheldon Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.
__Penny I understand.
__Sheldon Intriguing.
__Leonard Uh, hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.
__Penny Oh, okay, cool. I'm going to take a nap.
__Penny Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired, I've had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who's with me?
__Penny Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
__Howard Enough with the guilt, ma, we'll still see each other. I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.
__Sheldon Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We'll come back to that one.
__Alicia Please, you look cute. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.
__Howard I won't lie, it's pretty dope.
__Alicia That is so sweet. Come on in, let's open it.
__Leonard Alicia is an actress, just like you.
__Leonard You want to watch Battlestar?
__Raj So what are we going to do tonight?
__Howard I'm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.
__Raj You heard that, Ladies' Night ladies? We're eventually coming for you!
__Sheldon Get her out of here.
__Leonard Take me to a bar with women.
__Stuart Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?
__Penny Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
__Stuart Of course it is. It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
__Leonard Say what?
__Penny Mmm, what smells so good?
__Sheldon You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?
__Raj Not now, Leonard, Michaela's inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.
__Leonard Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a… you know…
__Leonard Yes.
__Stuart ‘Cause we're going out again tomorrow.
__Leonard No! There, it went to voice mail.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.
__Leonard Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.
__Leonard Great. So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
__Howard Where are you going?
__Sheldon I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master's degree.
__Penny What?
__Sheldon Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
__Sheldon Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?
__Raj Yeah, it was first come, first served.
__Howard That's why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.
__Raj He just went colon, capital O.
__Sheldon What's going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.
__Penny Why did you have to make him happy?
__Leonard Man, I cannot catch a break.
__Sheldon I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
__Leonard Uh, no, thank you.
__Mrs Cooper There's no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.
__Leonard Uh, if you don't mind, Mrs. Cooper, there's a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
__Howard What's there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.
__Raj Oh, yeah.
__Howard I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.
__Howard Are you crazy? We can't go down an empty elevator shaft.
__Sheldon Fine, if you don't want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I'll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
__Howard Don't push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.
__Sheldon Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It's really dark down here.
__Prof Crawley Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that's going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we're not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We're talking Oxnard in the onion fields.
__Penny No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
__Sheldon Oh, you'd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
__Sheldon I can't be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, “I give up, he's improbable.”
__Leonard Wow!
__Leonard What was that?
__Howard I'm actually much morelost than he is.
__Bethany Come on, I know a place you'll really dig.
__Leonard Unbelievable.
__Howard Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.
__Penny You're boring people sweetie.
__Howard Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, I believe you've misunderstood. I'm not giving you the job. I'm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we'll get started with the interview.
__Howard Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.
__Sheldon Top desk drawer.
__Howard Oh. I get it, I'm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I'll get out of your way. Uh, you're gonna want to eat those eggs while they're still hot.
__Sheldon Astro means star.
__Leonard Just play a potion card.
__Leonard See ya. Still can't believe she's going out with me.
__Sheldon I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
__Howard Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
__Penny I'm kidding.
__Sheldon Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
__Bernadette I know, I'm studying it.
__Bernadette A puppy once bit my face.
__Raj Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!
__Leonard Why wouldn't Penny want her friends to meet me?
__Sheldon Sorry won't bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
__Howard Whoa! Did you see that?
__Leonard Oh, that's excellent. It's a weird figure of speech, isn't it, we won when you weren't
__Leonard I's the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can't believe they had one for dogs.
__Leonard Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way.
__Sheldon I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
__Leonard Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he's challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he's right, 'cause if he's not, it'll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
__Raj What a douche.
__Sheldon Your turn, Leonard.
__Leonard No, you didn't.
__Leonard What was your first clue?
__Leonard I heard of 'em. Didn't know they were a band. Sheldon, she's gone. You can turn off the blender.
__Raj You mean like when a guy's upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn't show up because he's doing a juice fast with his mother?
__Howard Okay, sorry.
__Penny I'm busy.
__Sheldon Right now would be good.
__Howard I'm busy too, you answer it.
__Stuart Is everything okay?
__Penny All right, what's going on?
__Raj Big deal. Every time I watch that show it's old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
__Sheldon They're holding umbrellas.
__Howard Look, they gave me homemade cookies.
__Sheldon Okay, here.
__Raj The meteors don't get here, the earth is moving into their path.
__Penny Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
__Leonard Oh, god, I am so hungry.
__Howard You don't need forks. It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
__Howard You know, it's not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.
__Howard I'm taking a bath!
__Sheldon However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.
__Leonard I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even.
__Penny You want me to put it back?
__Penny Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?
__Bernadette I've been meaning to go over there.
__Sheldon All right.  Go away. I agree, it's rude, but she asked for privacy.
__Penny Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
__Howard Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
__Howard That's great, Ma!
__Penny Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
__Penny Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
__Leonard You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
__Leonard Um…
__Beverley Mmm, menopausal.
__Beverley She's a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.
__Beverley Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?
__Beverley Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I'm divorcing yours.
__Leonard You're right. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, I'm way out of line!
__Leonard That's a lousy conversation starter.
__Sheldon What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
__Howard Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.
__Sheldon In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.
__Bernadette Really uncomfortable.
__Sheldon It means come in. It's taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I'd learn Finnish.
__Penny And astrology.
__Leonard What the…?
__Leonard What about me?
__Policeman We're done here. Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
__Leonard Mm-hmm.
__Penny Yeah.
__Leonard What do you want?
__Sheldon I do tonight. It's scary over there.
__Man on TV Don't worry, there's no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard's room.)
__Sheldon What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?
__Howard Now, inside, we've got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.
__Howard I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
__Penny No, thanks.
__Penny Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
__Penny Oh, poor baby.
__Leonard Don't tell Koothrappali. After you.
__Leonard Because we didn't want to be disturbed.
__Penny Leonard doesn't snore.
__Sheldon A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don't like touching other people's coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.
__Leonard Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg's shih tzu.
__Howard I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.
__Howard Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.
__Sheldon Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?
__Raj Well, if anyone's interested, I'll be spending this Valentine's Day the same way I spend every Valentine's Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.
__Sheldon Alright, let's dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I'm here.
__Sheldon Very well. Enjoy yourself. You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
__Leonard You're not going to Switzerland!
__Leonard Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it's Penny, not you!
__Sheldon Great. I'll start packing. In a minute.  Oh, look, it's the cholermus.
__Sheldon Heated to 180 degrees?
__Penny I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Yes, it is.
__Penny Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
__Sheldon Howard?
__Sheldon I've taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don't worry, it's written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?
__Penny Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
__Guard Knock yourself out.
__Stuart We'll tell people he's your cousin.
__Sheldon We're not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
__Penny Okay.
__Sheldon Mine!
__Leonard You always get your way.
__Penny What ring?
__Leonard Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
__Penny Why?
__Penny Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?
__Howard If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.
__Raj Also my cousin.
__Sheldon Stop it!
__Raj Then let go of the ring and go.
__Howard You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
__Raj My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
__Howard Oh, that's not a good name.
__Raj Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.
__Penny Where the hell d'you find that?
__Leonard Why don't I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?
__Leonard Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
__Sheldon Oh, dear.
__Sheldon I'm getting dizzy.
__Sheldon I'm ready.
__Leonard Get into what? Why wouldn't you love the chilli cheese fries? They've been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
__Penny So, we're good?
__ After you.
__Wil Yes!
__Sheldon Harsh terms. But all right, I'll just substitute intercourse.
__Howard What's wrong with you? You can't hang out with your roommate's ex. That's totally uncool.
__Leonard You know what? I'll just spend the evening alone.
__Howard You said you were going for a walk.
__Leonard Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
__Sheldon Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
__Sheldon You may want to sit down.
__Penny How was I supposed to know that?
__Sheldon Thank you, Penny.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where's your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.
__Penny What? What are you doing with, what?
__Leonard Me neither. Oh, look what I'm reading. It's you.
__Leonard Wow. You really make science come alive.
__Leonard Morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I'm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Hey, you.
__Raj I bought a parrot.
__Howard Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?
__Leonard So you agree, he's nuts.
__Past Sheldon Correct. You've passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
__Past Leonard A car, yeah.
__Past Sheldon I can. I choose not to.
__Past Leonard Come on, I just asked.
__Past Sheldon But what's wrong with the furniture we have?
__Past Sheldon You're protected by your turtleneck.
__Past Sheldon You're welcome.
__Sheldon There you go.
__Leonard She didn't dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
__Zack Naked.
__Howard Yeah, right.
__Leonard How did I ruin him?
__Leonard I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.
__Leonard Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
__Howard Why?
__Leonard I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.
__Howard That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.
__Penny Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
__Penny Oh, God.
__Sheldon If you're looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we're having right now.
__Sheldon I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops. It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
__Penny Yeah, it's okay.
__Sheldon No.
__Raj A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.
__Penny Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh's strangely). What's (imitates Sheldon's laugh)
__Penny And that is?
__Sheldon Well, it's not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.
__Leonard Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What's KBB?
__Leonard I don't think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
__Sheldon By this much.
__Leonard Is somebody working on that?
__Penny For what?
__Sheldon Correct.
__Sheldon Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
__Leonard When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
__Leonard Good night.
__Penny Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
__Penny Oh, let me help you up.
__Penny It's not free, I'm gonna pay him back.  Shut up!
__Sheldon I'm behind you. Please look at me when you're talking to me.
__Sheldon You have to help, it's in the roommate agreement.
__Leonard I almost died!
__Steve Wozniak Nerds.
__Leonard This is ridiculous. You're just making stuff up.
__Raj Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
__Amy Oh. I don't like that. Don't do that.
__Sheldon It's how they lure you in. I believe it's called bait and switch.
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.
__Sheldon They can't function without me. I'm the social glue that holds this little group together. You're welcome.
__Raj Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.
__Howard Yeah, we all thought so.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon I don't follow.
__Leonard Cats, Sheldon. You're clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
__Sheldon You didn't break up, she dumped you.
__Penny What's up?
__Penny Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
__Howard And with that mental picture, I think we're done for the evening.
__Sheldon You're two for two.
__Leonard Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?
__Raj And I can put it in your office?
__Howard Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together?
__Leonard I don't know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you're not a real boy.
__Sheldon All right, I see what's going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.
__Bernadette What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
__Howard Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and…
__Bernadette So you've been seeing other girls?
__Raj Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!
__Raj Eat flaming Nerf!
__Sheldon I'm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
__Sheldon That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She'll appreciate the witticism.
__Howard Hey.
__Leonard You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.
__Raj Two words, deaf chick. It doesn't matter if I can't talk, because she can't hear me.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Leonard Why don't you just break up with her?
__Leonard What the hell? How long has she been here?
__ Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
__Sheldon Uh-huh.
__Leonard What if she just comes over?
__Leonard Hi.
__Leonard Whoa!
__Joy 73!
__Amy I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
__Mrs Fowler Oh!
__Priya I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.
__Leonard Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
__Howard Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy?
__Sheldon Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don't have the sword. Good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.
__Leonard Air freshener.
__Sheldon Very well, I'm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.
__Sheldon Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It's usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.
__Sheldon Excellent choice.
__Sheldon Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?
__Sheldon In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.
__Howard How could you? We had a pact!
__Sheldon Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
__Sheldon No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.
__Page I see.
__Page Excuse me?
__Page Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
__Leonard Good. It's a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.
__Leonard Could you get that?
__Sheldon I suppose I could if I were asked.
__Page Fidelity, bravery, integrity?
__Sheldon You heard me say blu-ray, right?
__Sheldon Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.
__Leonard Did something happen today that's bothering you?
__Leonard How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
__Sheldon You're tricking me. It really is, isn't it?
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon I'll reprogram Howard.
__Sheldon Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it's already five o'clock. Let's go.
__Howard You know, if we miss it, we'll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.
__Amy Yes, but they're not girls. I'm a girl.
__Amy What's the dress code?
__Raj Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.
__Bernadette Gee, I don't know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I've got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.
__Theatre Staff Wil Wheaton.
__Sheldon This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.
__Sheldon I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!
__Theatre staff We're full up.
__Sheldon You whistled?
__Amy Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.
__Leonard You'll never guess what just happened.
__Howard How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
__ Well, then, what do you want?
__Howard No!
__Wyatt Let me finish.
__Penny Oh.
__Wyatt Just don't panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!
__Howard Hey.
__Leonard You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?
__Penny Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.
__Raj Yeah, Leonard, who?
__Sheldon Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.
__Howard Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
__Amy No.
__Sheldon The alternative would be to think backwards. And that's just remembering.
__Amy It's not what I want to do, it's what I have to do.
__Amy Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare's metaphorical beast with two backs.
__Leonard Do you understand why people don't want to play with you?
__Penny Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
__Zack Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.
__Sheldon That's not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
__Raj First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
__Sheldon Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.
__Raj Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
__Leonard It's Leonard.
__Leonard Okay, listen. You don't have to wear the wig. At this party, we're gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
__Howard Sheldon, I don't think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential…
__Sheldon Of Texas.
__Sheldon Oh, is it? Well let's see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.
__Sheldon A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we're a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
__Leonard Well, yes, and you're listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
__Leonard But I fired you.
__Sheldon Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.
__Sheldon Bored.
__Penny Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
__Penny I, I wasn't going to.
__Penny Brawny?
__Amy Word of warning, though. I'm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.
__Penny Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.
__Leonard Okay, when you say make the best of it.
__Penny Sleep.
__Leonard I've gotten a lot better at that, you know. I've dated four different women since we broke up and I didn't tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
__Howard Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.
__Bernadette Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
__Howard Apparently, if you're Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.
__Howard Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.
__Leonard Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
__Penny Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.
__Raj Dude, that's incredible!
__Sheldon I'm sorry. You'll be Spock?
__Penny Now just read your mother's line.
__ Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
__Chorus of everyone in cafeteria Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!
__Dr. Seibert Hey, there's my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?
__Sheldon That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?
__Raj Sounds great!
__Seibert Ah. There's my band of brainiacs. Where's Dr. Cooper?
__Leonard Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
__Amy Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.
__Amy I'm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?
__Sheldon Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.
__Leonard Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
__Leonard Well, n-no, hold on a second, I'm not going to sleep with her.
__Leonard Oh.
__Mrs Latham It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.
__Mrs Latham Well, aren't you sweet. Just for the record, you'd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.
__Howard No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.
__Raj It's completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I'll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me.  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.
__Priya I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.
__Howard Uh…
__Priya Rajesh, don't be a child.
__Mrs Wolowitz Where were you?
__Sheldon Because we don't throw parties.
__Leonard Right.
__Sheldon Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it's Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer's Stone.
__Penny Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.
__Sheldon Cluck-cluck-cluck.
__Amy So needy.
__Sheldon And good-bye to you, sir. He'll be back.
__Sheldon Forgive me, but I think you'll find my story is more interesting.
__Sheldon Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.
__Raj I'd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
__Bernadette But you could if you wanted to, right?
__Amy You know, if being on your own is new to you, I'd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I've perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?
__Penny Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
__Amy Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.
__Stuart Dibs.
__Priya Sheldon, do you want some or not?
__Sheldon Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?
__Penny Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard And she likes you.
__Sheldon I hate you.
__Sheldon That's from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?
__Leonard I'm on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
__Penny Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.
__Leonard Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it's fun.
__Penny Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.
__Sheldon I've never said these words before, but good job, Howard!
__Raj Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.
__Raj Me, too.
__Sheldon That's uncanny.
__Leonard Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.
__Leonard Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's bat'lething anybody.
__Todd Yeah. Who are you?
__Sheldon Really, Amy? Gossip? I'm disappointed in you.
__Leonard Marry you?
__Raj What?
__Sheldon Yes, I believe so.
__Howard I know things haven't been perfect with us, and we've had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I…
__Sheldon Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.
__Penny Hey. What's up?
__Amy I need some context.
__Amy Make yourself comfortable.
__Priya Give him what he wants or we're done.
__Amy Yes. I also found a Korean man's business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
__Leonard Elegant.
__Amy Yeah, yeah. I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
__Amy I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn't have any.
__Sheldon Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.
__Bernadette Obviously, this one doesn't.
__Howard I'm not grilling you, I was just curious.
__Penny All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
__Raj Okay, let's see if this drug works.
__Woman at table Can I help you?
__Raj My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
__Leonard Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
__ Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
__Leonard My water. You're drinking it.
__Bernadette You guys ready to order?
__Priya Is it diet?
__Howard I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
__Raj Oh, that sounds lovely.
__Sheldon Jibber-jabber? I don't jibber-jabber.
__Howard They're running tests. I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
__Howard It's not important.
__Sheldon This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!
__Doctor You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?
__Priya Oh, the poor thing.
__Raj Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.
__Howard You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.
__Priya Shh, my brother's going to hear you.
__Howard No, Ma! It's Raj!
__Sheldon All right.
__Sheldon When does a monkey have a trunk?
__Raj Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.
__Leonard She lied.
__Raj That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.
__Sheldon For the record, I do have genitals. They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.
__Amy She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I'm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.
__Amy You can't blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.
__Penny Somewhere where no one's seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile.
__Leonard Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.
__Raj No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.
__Penny Oh!
__Raj Penny, please, please promise me you won't tell anybody about this.
__Penny Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent. You're kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe it! Really? Oh, I'm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
__Sheldon Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
__Penny I want a divorce.
__Sheldon What?
__Howard What? You're having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you're doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try.
__Raj I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.
__Penny No, it's completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.
__Raj Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment, I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor all the time.
__Sheldon No, Penny, don't give up, you can get this.
__Bernadette I'm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.
__Penny Really? For a wedding?
__Amy Perhaps you're right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
__Howard Problem solved.
__Penny Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
__Penny Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
__Raj Then spell it.
__Raj I was so smooth on that date.
__Leonard Could you tell us?
__Howard He's not going to listen, he's in love.
__Penny We didn't mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
__Raj Yeah, that's good. Keep telling yourself that.
__Raj Penny?
__Raj Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she's still with me. But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.
__Leonard Yeah, real big of you.
__Leonard Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.
__Sheldon Only 8,000? We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
__Leonard Two hundred.
__Leonard Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
__Bernadette Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.
__Bernadette No, I've just been thinking. It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety. I don't want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.
__Penny Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
__Sheldon Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.
__Brent Eighteen.
__Sheldon I don't know. Lately we've been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
__Sheldon Get them before they get us.
__Penny Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while. I'm getting back out there.
__Raj Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.
__Hot girl Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?
__Leonard You're kidding. You have your own book?
__Alice You'd think, but no.
__Leonard You can have my car.
__Penny Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.
__Leonard Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do.
__Leonard Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
__Sheldon Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that? You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‘er there, you son of a gun!
__Priya Oh, sounds serious. What's up?
__Leonard No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
__Leonard Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't believe this.
__Amy Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.
__Amy Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I'm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.
__Sheldon Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I'm worried Amy's been eaten by a bobcat.
__Sheldon She sounds weepy. I don't like weepy. Let's go.
__Raj This is not a safe place. You can't share anything here.
__Sheldon Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.
__Penny Thank you. Where's Sheldon?
__ the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.
__Penny What is that about?
__Leonard Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
__Raj I really don't get your problem with birds.
__Leonard Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
__Man It's a working title.
__Man I'm Kevin.
__Sheldon Yes. It's very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.
__Leonard I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I'm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry.
__Leonard It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
__Raj A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
__Leonard You know what? Never mind. I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.
__Dale I don't know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.
__Sheldon Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
__Sheldon You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.
__Amy Sheldon, what are you doing here?
__Amy Anything else?
__Amy Hi, Stuart.
__Bernadette Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.
__Amy That's nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
__Penny Oh. I don't know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn't really have bullies.
__Penny Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
__Leonard 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
__Sheldon In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.
__Sheldon Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I'm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
__Sheldon Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don't know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
__Sheldon She'd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it's this.
__Bernadette Did it work?
__Howard I just gave it to her!
__Howard She's not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!
__Leonard You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What's going on?
__Sheldon Nuts to that. What else you got?
__Howard Well, yeah.
__Sheldon No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
__Howard Huh, it'll kill her. On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren, that'll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden.
__Amy Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It's a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
__Mrs Wolowitz Don't forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don't get grandkids!
__Amy Guess it'll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
__Sheldon Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
__Penny Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
__Leonard Why? What are you afraid of?
__Bernadette I'm a very vengeful person.
__Penny No, that's okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don't work out.
__Penny Is the point that you don't know when to let something go?
__Sheldon Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.
__Penny The hell do you think you're going?
__Amy Ooh!
__ Penny?
__Sheldon Cut! Take 47.
__Howard Look at that. There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
__Raj I haven't bonded with it.
__Penny Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
__Penny Yeah. Oh. Here's my list for you, right there.
__Penny Okay, you're kind of really great.
__Sheldon You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?
__Stuart Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
__Sheldon Great. Great. So, what's new with your family? How's your mother? Is she alive?
__Leonard Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
__Leonard I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.
__Penny Aw.
__Leonard So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?
__Leonard Can I sit in your spot?
__Sheldon No.
__Howard I haven't seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
__Penny You know, I'm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you're in bed with him. That's how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That's how I told his brother the same thing.
__Leonard Joke all you want, but you think about it.
__Sheldon Way to kill the mood.
__Sheldon You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
__Amy How's it going?
__Amy Okay, smart guy. I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
__Bernadette And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you're Jewish.
__Sheldon This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.
__Penny All right, it's got to go.
__Bernadette Mmm, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.
__ Later. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.
__Leonard You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
__Kripke Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn't come down.) Do I get points for that?
__Bernadette Good night, transvestite Penny.
__Amy Come on.
__Sheldon Why is there a hole in my new office? I' There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out.
__Leonard If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
__Sheldon Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.
__Sheldon When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.
__Sheldon Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
__Sheldon I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
__ to astronaut training to Sheldon can't get a haircut?
__Howard I got a look at the centrifuge they're going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Leonard Great. What are you going to do first?
__Howard What are you doing here?
__Leonard I'm sorry, duh, what?
__Sheldon Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.
__Raj We were badass back in the day.
__Sheldon Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego's? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
__Penny Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
__Sheldon All right.
__Penny Oh, come on. They're playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again…
__Amy How do I get him to treat me better?
__Penny Ooh, burn!
__Sheldon I think I understand. You're the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can't lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.
__Penny I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
__Dr Koothrappali And it's been wonderful.
__Lakshmi I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
__Raj Okay, what page are you on?
__Raj We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian.
__Howard Then why did she even go out with you?
__Penny What is your problem?
__Raj Oh, my goodness. Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?
__Sheldon Oh!
__Howard Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.
__Howard Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
__Penny Wow, are these Amy's? Kind of trashy, good for her.
__Penny I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.
__Bernadette Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
__Sheldon Fine. You have very tiny hands.
__Howard No, but what is it?
__Raj I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
__Penny Hey.
__Penny Yeah, sure, I guess.
__Leonard why are you?
__Penny Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father.
__Howard No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.
__Bernadette Oh, you're in a good mood.
__Howard Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Mr. Rostenkowski No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you… You just gonna stand there?
__Mr. Rostenkowski It did not get better.
__Cosmonaut He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?
__Cosmonaut Congratulations.
__Amy It's all I have left. You're going to take that from me, too?
__Amy Can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
__Howard I'm excited to talk to you, too.
__Leonard Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought…
__Raj I'm all for it.
__Leonard Oh, I'll get it. Go sports.
__Dimitri A woman who says she's your mother but sounds like your father.
__Howard Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.
__Raj Perfect for the night I'm having. Thank you.
__Raj No problem. My treat. I'll swing by after work.
__Stuart I could do worse.
__Bernadette I had no idea you were unhappy.
__Howard Excuse me. I'm talking to my friends.
__Sheldon Equally ridiculous. Let's go.
__Amy There might be a reason for that.
__Sheldon Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
__Amy She's not sure how she feels.
__Sheldon Good night. I'm sorry. This is really important.
__Penny What?
__Howard Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?
__Sheldon Oh, thank you, Penny.
__Leonard Not gonna happen.
__Amy All right. Well, tell him Amy called.
__Sheldon Two cherries?
__Alex Um, top one, yes. I didn't check the one on the bottom.
__Sheldon It's all right, Alex. I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.
__Leonard So, Alex, what's the topic of your dissertation?
__Sheldon It's an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
__Amy Yes.
__ Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
__Sheldon No, that's not fair either.
__Mrs Wolowitz Howard? I thought I wasn't going to see you till tomorrow.
__Leonard Because he's hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There's Waldo.
__Howard Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I'm like an inch and a half taller. I'm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.
__Howard No, no, you guys go. Have fun.
__Amy So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
__Leonard Hey, what are you doing here?
__Penny Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?
__Leonard No, no. It's kind of crazy. I've never fooled around in the lab before.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.
__Howard Okay, no problem. It won't happen again.
__Howard I don't care. Get the Tardis.
__Sheldon What's a hickey?
__Bernadette Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that's like the funniest thing I've ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?
__Sheldon It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I'm spanking him so hard his grad students won't be able to sit down.
__Penny Anyway, that's it. I just thought you should know.
__Leonard Don't ask me. A little elf did it.
__Leonard Please don't be upset. I just, I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.
__Amy Understood.
__Wil Um, no offence, but I've been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.
__Amy Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.
__Sheldon Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
__Sheldon Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
__Amy I'm mad at you, Sheldon.
__Bernadette Kitchen slammed again?
__Bernadette What's your excuse this time?
__Sheldon Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.
__Sheldon It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down.
__Sheldon I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
__Penny Oh, just this guy I met at school.
__Leonard Come on, trust me, he's hitting on you.
__Howard Come on.
__Howard It's locked.
__Raj Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
__Penny Hey, shouldn't you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?
__Sheldon Very well. You leave me no choice.
__Bernadette You hit her! What did I do?
__Howard Okay, you need to move now.
__Sheldon Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?
__Sheldon To burying the hatchet.
__Leonard Penny's working tonight, I'm in.
__Amy Sheldon, you don't get over the flu in half an hour.
__Howard Took the words right out of my mouth.
__Howard Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
__Amy See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
__Penny Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?
__Stuart Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
__Leonard Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you're out of the game.
__Bernadette Think harder.
__Raj Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn't, I mean, at all. What?
__Stuart What was so bad about them?
__Raj Now that I know she doesn't like me, I'm kind of into her.
__Stuart I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
__Alex Hey, Leonard.
__Leonard Ah, I'd love to, but I'm supposed to hang out with Penny.
__Sheldon Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?
__Leonard I'm androgynous?
__Sheldon No, uh, no, I'm sorry. Who's talking about Leonard and Alex?
__Bernadette I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
__Alex What?
__HR Woman Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.
__Sheldon Like what?
__HR Woman Whuh-ah! Woah! You can't talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I'm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.
__Penny No.
__Penny I can't help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.
__Sheldon It's a comic book convention. You know, it's like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one's still pretty good.
__Penny Oh. It's Leonard. He says they're on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it's the mimosa, but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.
__Amy Seriously?
__Leonard I'm turning it on, but just to shut you up.
__Sheldon I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
__Raj That is so cool.
__GPS Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here's an interesting fact about interstates.
__Leonard Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It's cooler than it sounds.
__Raj It, it is. It's not just comic books. They've got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.
__Bernadette Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.
__Howard Easy. His family's loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.
__Leonard Maybe it's a shipping problem.
__Penny What beverage do you make for that?
__Sheldon How do I know you're not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
__Sheldon And I am sure it's still more valuable than whatever's in here.
__Leonard Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
__Sheldon Well, word around the university is I'm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.
__Penny Oh, my God!  Sheldon, I know this wasn't easy for you, and I'm really glad we could have this conversation.
__Kripke A wocket? You'we a fweak! I wove it!
__Leonard What?
__Raj Is there a good anal leakage?
__Howard Really? What do you got going on?
__Sheldon Wait. Here who is where?
__Amy See? You can't. I'm gonna go see if Leonard's room is big enough for my water bed.
__Leonard Is that so?
__Sheldon Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I'll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I'll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.
__Howard What time did you leave?
__Raj They're on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
__Sheldon You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy's out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I'd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.
__Penny Well, you know how he is. He's sensitive and emotional.
__Howard Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?
__Amy ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.
__Howard Bernie's a little cranky since she's been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I've got a lot on my plate, too, because I've been busting my tail playing Assassin's Creed.
__Leonard Oh, I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.
__Bernadette I've been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.
__Stuart That does sound nice.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon.
__Girl Yeah, I do.
__Penny I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It's something we work on in my acting class.
__Leonard Raj, what's going on?
__Amy Fine. Just hold on. Mommy's on the phone! Sorry. We've cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.
__Howard Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you're only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.
__Girl Oh, no, I can't stay.
__Girl Well, how do I know you're not just saying that?
__Girl Okay. Text me. Bye.
__Sheldon She's remarkable.
__Leonard Helping women? Y
__Sheldon How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
__Leonard and Howard No!
__Raj No, you can't join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.
__Girl Did you fly the rocket?
__Bernadette Well, hello, Prince Charming.
__Bernadette Why?
__Bernadette That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.
__Sheldon Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed…
__Penny Really? You couldn't just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
__Bernadette You must be curious.
__Bernadette Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day 'cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don't know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.
__Sheldon Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?
__Amy Absolutely.
__Howard I am.
__Howard Sheldon, I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you.
__Penny I know.
__Leonard Mm, not really.
__Leonard Well, I'm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'll be throwing my hat in the ring.
__Janine Hey, Barry.
__Leonard That's enough cardio for me. I'm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
__Janine God, they're everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?
__Raj Where have you been?
__Howard You guys going to Professor Tupperman's memorial?
__Raj Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
__Sheldon You're here.
__Leonard Do it.
__Sheldon I don't want any more, but let's go.
__Sheldon Dumplings? Don't you understand what's going on here?
__Raj It's not creepy. Don't listen to him. Oh, look who's got the sweetest kisses.
__Howard Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?
__Howard The key to her heart. That's nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
__Raj What do you mean?
__ Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!
__Sheldon I'm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
__ Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should've told you about the broken elevator.
__Arthur That doesn't answer my question.
__Arthur Well, there, there really isn't too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children's parties to, to make a living.
__Leonard Then what is it?
__Leonard You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
__Howard Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one's always a throwaway. How's this look?
__Bernadette So you knew she was okay, and you couldn't pick up the phone to tell us?
__Arthur No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.
__Bernadette No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.
__Raj Anything can happen.
__Sheldon Go on, give him your lunch money.
__Raj That's great.
__Howard Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.
__Howard Fine.  You'd think, after all these years, I'd know not to fly over volcanoes. I'm a freaking idiot.
__Leonard Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.
__Sheldon You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
__Sheldon And now what?
__Amy Okay.
__Raj It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
__Sheldon Great. I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
__Sheldon Well, that's the thing about factoids, they're interesting.
__Lucy Six strangers? That's a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?
__Penny On a ship? Aren't they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
__Leonard Sheldon's nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I'm gone.
__Howard Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they're actually going on a voyage?
__Leonard Oh. Thank you, Raj. I'd be honoured.
__Sheldon How?
__Howard Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
__Howard It must've killed you when I went to space.
__Howard Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.
__Penny Oh, Raj.
__Raj You would do that for me?
__Penny Okay, let's take a break.
__Sheldon We're all out of alcohol.
__Bernadette Thanks.
__Howard So nothing.
__Leonard Keep your voice down.
__Sheldon I'm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.
__Howard Yeah, that's cucumber and cream cheese. That's turkey and loganberry. And don't tell my hips, but I'm warming up a brie in the oven.
__Raj I'm not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let's see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can't tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.
__Howard Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.
__Leonard Where do you think I would take you?
__Leonard Fine. What I did was wrong.
__Leonard Stop it.
__Penny He's still mad at Leonard, huh?
__Penny Sheldon.
__Howard That's so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.
__Raj Well, we've all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.
__Penny What?
__Howard You're full of oestrogen and you don't act like that.
__Sheldon Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It's a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.
__Sheldon Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that's it. I'm catching her in the act.
__Sheldon Aha.
__Howard Fine.
__Leonard Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?
__Sheldon I don't think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
__Howard Why?
__Amy Yeah, me, too.
__Raj Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.
__Amy Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
__Bernadette I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
__Both Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I've been inclined…
__Bernadette Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I'm in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
__Leonard Almost.
__Penny Yeah, well, you should have quit 'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.
__Amy It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
__Penny Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.
__Raj My parents' money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?
__Raj Okay, now you're talking like a winner!
__Sheldon Ooh, I think she's a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.
__Bernadette And I'm not buying it. Try again.
__Howard I'm copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.
__Leonard Your father's a gynaecologist.
__Leonard Please, oh, please, just let me be there.
__Amy I don't mind. I'm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
__Penny That's different. I'm not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
__Amy I didn't ask for your permission.
__Howard For the love of God, why?
__Sheldon Hello.
__Amy And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Raj You want a TUMS?
__Howard Oh, hi.
__Amy Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I'm just going to ignore him.
__All Yeah!
__Penny Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?
__Sheldon I've made a horrible mistake.
__Amy You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we're forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.
__Howard No, I want this to be romantic.
__Leonard Oh, no.
__Howard If I didn't have you life would be dreary, I'd be string theory without any string. I'd be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I'd be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I'd speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam.
__Leonard Oh, rose petals.
__Leonard I can't believe you saved all this stuff.
__Leonard He thinks there's a difference.
__Amy Yes, and I've heard so much about you. Hey look, we're wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can't believe I dress like a celebrity.
__Leonard Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, did I wake you?
__Amy Wow, Penny, good job.
__Amy What are you working on?
__Howard I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn't have a neck. She's just chins and fat and feet.
__Leonard No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.
__Arthur Oh. Uh, great.
__Sheldon Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.
__Raj Oh gets better.
__Penny Sorry, they're both married.
__Leonard Sure.
__Amy At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.
__Penny I'm sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?
__Raj Good, good. ‘Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.
__Sheldon There's probably a deep reason. Which I'd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
__Amy Sheldon, that was diabolical.
__Amy We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?
__Penny So how do I undo this?
__Leonard Oh, she's mad at me because she just found out she's married to Zack.
__Penny Ugh, I need some air.
__Howard Thank God.
__Mike Me, too.
__Zack Don't be. It's my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.
__Sheldon But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
__Amy Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.
__Raj No, I'm gonna brush Cinnamon's teeth.
__Bernadette Hey, guys. Sorry I'm so late. Did you already have dinner?
__Bernadette Thank you, Raj.
__Leonard No, it's all over.
__Penny Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled,
__Leonard Come on, don't give him a hard time.
__Howard Are you kidding? You're the best. I know what the problem is. It's him.
__Penny You know, if it makes you feel any better…
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Leonard Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
__Amy Right now? Why?
__Penny Oh, she's pregnant? That's great. You're gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.
__Raj You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.
__Bernadette Hey, I brought over It's a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.
__Howard She nailed it.
__Raj My father's a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I'm gay.
__Raj Ew.
__Sheldon I don't know. I just got back.
__Bernadette How is this any different?
__Sheldon That's it. The baby's here. It's a boy.
__Sheldon Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.
__Sheldon I don't think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don't usually change. Well, they don't.
__Penny Hey, guys, don't forget, my episode's on TV tomorrow night.
__Sheldon Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they're German, 'cause that's a tough crowd.
__Leonard I know, but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts.
__Penny Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he's missing and the sandwich is missing, and they're probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
__Penny I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.
__Leonard Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we'll come back to that.
__Penny No, forget it. I take it back. Offer's off the table.
__Howard I'm in the middle of something.
__Leonard It doesn't.
__Leonard Look, if you want to break up, just say it.
__Leonard No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don't say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.
__Sheldon Too bad. I'm coming with you.
__Stuart Uh, well, it's, it's pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
__Bernadette You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
__Bert Hi, Amy. I, oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had any company.
__Penny Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
__Amy Hello, Bert.
__Jesse Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.
__Stuart You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
__Amy Okay, I don't have time for this. I'm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.
__Sheldon Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let's all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.
__Raj We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.
__Sheldon Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.
__Leonard Not yet.
__Sheldon Oh, Sunday's the worst. Everybody's leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.
__Sheldon I can't believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
__Sheldon I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
__Penny Yes, like a museum, but anything else.
__Sheldon Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he's looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That's where he'll be, and that's where I'm going, and…
__Howard And that's where Darth Vader's gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
__Raj Does he sound like a criminal?
__Bernadette I could go for a drink.
__Leonard Even Batman breaks the rules.
__Howard Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
__Raj What about that little cup they give you?
__Leonard Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
__Sheldon It's like there' Oh, yeah. I've got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo.
__Amy See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
__Amy Why do I even try?
__Sheldon Come on.
__Sheldon Well, if you want romance, then let's have romance. Oh, look, there's wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let's gaze into each other's eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.
__Leonard Well, give it a go.
__Sheldon You'll get 'em next time.
__Bernadette Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
__Raj Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl's there ten seconds, and suddenly we're all running to IKEA.
__Penny Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?
__Leonard Fancy sounds like a compliment.
__Leonard Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.
__Sheldon Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?
__Penny Well, I'm glad you're still together.
__Raj Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
__Leonard Fine.
__Sheldon Am I missing something, or isn't that the part she was born to play?
__Raj If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.
__Amy That's true. Do whatever you want.
__Amy Look, I'll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.
__Bernadette I said to stop insulting each other. I didn't tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
__Amy I don't know.
__Leonard Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?
__Sheldon Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.
__Leonard Hmm, I'm a professor at Stanford.
__Sheldon Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.
__Sheldon Well, someone has to.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, dear Lord.
__Amy It actually was kind of fun.
__Raj And it's done.
__Leonard All right, I'll see you guys in 20 years.
__Penny What is this, my first day?
__Bernadette “LOL.” Smiley face.
__Amy You'll get offered something soon.
__Raj Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I'm sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.
__Penny Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.
__Leonard Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.
__Raj As a matter of fact, I did. I've spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I'm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer's going to be yes.
__Howard He's gonna die alone, right?
__Emily Thanks. I love that jacket.
__Emily I'm still here.
__Emily We just met. You don't need to tell me about other people you're seeing.
__Sheldon Your failed attempt to go back to college?
__Raj You're really going to do this?
__Penny Oh my God, I do look like that.
__Leonard Hey, I've got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don't know.
__Penny Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
__Sheldon A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
__Bernadette We moved on.
__Leonard Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
__Answerphone Next message.
__Penny Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?
__Penny Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.
__Raj Uh, so, you'll watch it?
__Raj All right, let's get this over with. Ew, it's got someone's hair on it.
__Leonard I also love you.
__Penny Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
__Penny No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
__Sheldon Oh. That's a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
__Amy Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.
__Penny Wow, you really struck a nerve. I've never heard him use the M word before.
__Amy Are you sure you don't want to go say good-bye?
__Howard You're being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
__Penny Sweetie, are you sure you don't want to come with us to the funeral?
__Leonard Oh that's, that's fine. Go ahead.
__Sheldon Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.
__Leonard What?
__Arthur Is, is this the, the first time you've lost, you know, someone close to you?
__Amy Hey, guys.
__Arthur I mean, don't, don't you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you're spending your limited time on Earth?
__Raj Please hurry.
__Mrs Wolowitz I'm still hungry.
__Penny Oh, really?
__Leonard Can I get you anything?
__Penny With my life.
__Leonard Not like, I guess I'm in. Like I guess, I'm in!
__Mrs Wolowitz Where's my pancakes?!
__Howard She's doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.
__ Hey, hey, what the hell?
__Bernadette Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.
__Mrs Hofstadter In any event, while I've had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she's good enough for me.
__Mrs Hofstadter Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?
__Amy That's nice.
__Leonard Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‘Cause that's important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.
__Sheldon So, tomorrow?
__Leonard Yeah, time's gonna fly by.
__Bernadette Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He's the guy who'll be interviewing you.
__Sheldon Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.
__Sheldon Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
__Bernadette Okay, calm down. You're not his father, he's not your father. Nobody's anybody's father.
__Bernadette Hey, don't you take that sarcastic tone with him.
__Sheldon Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.
__Penny What happens if you don't?
__Penny Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.
__Raj Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.
__Amy I don't know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
__Howard Oh, come on. You might've gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.
__Amy But I'm just…
__Sheldon Why?
__Howard So I can shoot you with a spitball.
__Sheldon Oh! It's not even Easter time. This is crazy.
__Leonard Baseball.
__Penny For what?
__Penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.
__Amy After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.
__Bernadette I'll let you know.
__Bernadette That's sixty feet.
__Penny Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.
__Leonard I'm not jealous. I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships like they're something that can be quantified.
__Leonard How ridiculous is he?
__Bernadette Okay.
__Howard Heads up! Watch out!
__Howard But it's for a good cause. What about all the kids that'll be there?
__Penny Can he really throw a ball?
__Raj Hey, guys.
__Amy You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
__Emily So, it was a hook-up.
__Howard Toy stores, puppet shows.
__Sheldon On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next.
__Bernadette And I'm sure you can turn it around.
__Amy You're right. Cheers.
__Bernadette Nope.
__Penny Bye.
__Sheldon Well, I guess it was too good to be true.
__Sheldon I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.
__Raj Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
__Sheldon If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty's hover board, that would have universal application.
__Penny Well, we're in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.
__Amy What?
__Amy What does that mean?
__Bernadette That sucks.
__Bernadette You sure?
__Amy It is. But enough about Penny. Let's talk about us. We're looking good.
__Leonard If only we had one.
__Amy Why'd you tell her? It was working.
__Penny You guys look like you're having fun.
__Leonard We didn't have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we're leaning towards quantum coupling… Aah! Why?
__Sheldon You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That's a tangent and it's your fault.
__Raj Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.
__Penny You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
__Leonard The one I gave you?
__Raj Exactly.
__Raj We're going to be fine.
__Howard I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.
__Bernadette Was it more or less than falconry school?
__Raj Let's set up the equipment. It'll help take your mind off of it.
__Sheldon Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
__Raj It's a little more bleak than I thought.
__Raj How's that going?
__Man I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.
__Leonard What? Why didn't you say that first?
__Amy I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.
__Man Anytime. Uh, I've got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.
__Leonard So, uh, what's the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?
__Dr Lorvis Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.
__Dr Lorvis She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.
__Amy That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
__Raj Like who?
__Howard Like you and your dog.
__Leonard Don't rule out the dating.
__Penny Oh, great. I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.
__Penny Ah, You guys are the best.
__Leonard What?
__Howard You know exactly who it is. He's gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
__Penny You knocked more than usual.
__Sheldon Why would you say that?
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Bernadette Aw, that movie's so cute.
__Penny Well, who'd you go with?
__Leonard There's no music.
__Sheldon I really did think you looked pretty.
__Sheldon I love you, too.
__Bernadette They're yours in the divorce.
__Leonard Buddy, I, I get that you're worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.
__Leonard If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn't you die, too?
__Sheldon That's a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?
__Howard Told you, not funny.
__Sheldon Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.
__Howard And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It's like washing myself with a hamster.
__ Crikey, what flag do we have today?
__Sheldon You do this, I delete your contact information.
__Sheldon I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.
__Howard And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.
__Dr Koothrappali Twenty hours.
__Bernadette So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
__Howard And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
__Penny Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.
__Howard On three. One, two, three.
__Leonard I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.
__Howard We can't do that.
__Sheldon But what about our agreement?
__Amy One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.
__Leonard Yes.
__Amy I actually can't go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
__Howard I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour…
__Sheldon I'll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
__Howard You love that movie.
__Penny Absolutely. You name it, we're doing it.
__Amy Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.
__Penny Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard's not gonna move out until you're ready.
__Leonard Yeah, sure.
__Leonard Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, then do it.
__Sheldon Of course.
__Howard That was the last one, I promise. We won't play any more.
__Raj Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.
__Amy That's not true.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I have been hallucinating lately.
__Leonard You're sure it's good?
__Bernadette No, give me the remote.
__Amy Play it again. Play it again.
__Penny Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
__Bernadette Why? Why did it feel different?
__Leonard You really didn't like our paper?
__Bernadette Please?
__Barry Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.
__Penny Oh, that sounds like a good thing.
__Stuart Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.
__Sheldon Penny?
__Penny What?
__Raj What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.
__Raj Don't know why he's so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I'm still floating.
__Penny I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.
__Raj What can we do?
__Howard I don't know.
__Amy And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.
__Amy No.
__Leonard Ladies?
__Bernadette So, where is it?
__Penny Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.
__Bernadette What?
__Penny Yes.
__Sheldon Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.
__Sheldon I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How'd you like to come home with us? You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house.
__Sheldon Oh, there's this company that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
__Penny You went to the dirty store without me?
__Howard We should hang up.
__Penny We sure did.
__Amy Try again.
__Sheldon Well, I don't know, we're all Groot? Just tell me.
__Sheldon Okay, I have to tell you something, but you're not going to like it.
__Sheldon You know, you're right. Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he's far richer. And he's a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.
__Howard No. All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.
__Howard Okay. Then how about this? Let's invite everyone over to dinner. It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.
__Bernadette You okay?
__Howard Hey, guys.
__Stuart It's true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.
__Bernadette I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We're eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there's no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. And don't think…
__Bernadette Good news, I found more Tums.
__Leonard I don't know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?
__Howard Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
__Leonard Exactly.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Bernadette How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
__Leonard Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.
__Raj What?
__Bernadette I don't know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool 'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don't know much about<i> Doctor Who.
__Howard This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?
__Amy Uh, it, it's been a long time. I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.
__Sheldon Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who…
__Bernadette Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.
__Raj Hey, I got you a little gift.
__Howard Nope.
__Penny Sorry.
__Leonard Hey, great.
__Kevin Yeah, you tell him, Penny.
__Amy When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.
__Raj All right, I've got your back.
__Penny Don't you have a guy?
__Amy Okay, have a seat on the floor.
__Penny Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.
__Howard In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.
__Leonard All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
__Howard Hello.
__Howard I'll figure it out.
__Leonard Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?
__Leonard I'll take my chances.
__Amy With a beautiful girl on your arm.
__Sheldon Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… eleven. It's a good thing I didn't send that letter.
__Raj Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?
__Sheldon Won't that void the warranty?
__Penny Oh. Well, you do.
__Howard Thank you.
__Leonard They're graduating.
__Sheldon Well, my mother's been there for every honour I've won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?
__Sheldon You act like I didn't get you that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.
__Amy Do you think the moms will get along?
__Leonard Uh, I don't know. They're pretty different.
__Leonard What does that mean?
__Dr Hofstadter You're kidding, right?
__Bernadette We talked about this. I don't mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.
__Dr Hofstadter Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.
__Mrs Cooper No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.
__Mrs Cooper I know the answer. You're not gonna like it.
__Penny I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.
__Sheldon Whenever you're ready.
__Sheldon Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
__Howard How are you saying that with a straight face?
__Raj You guys are being jerks.
__Penny Still haven't heard from her?
__Sheldon Too slow?
__Penny Uh, hello.
__Howard Yeah, right. Sick. He didn't have jaundice. He just looks like that.
__Leonard Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.
__Leonard It is. It is about us.
__Penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we're about to get married and you're trying to sabotage it.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Penny Why would we want that?
__Sheldon We make everyone feel awkward. That's our thing.
__Bernadette Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.
__Penny It's just, when we were kissing, I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.
__Penny You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
__Sheldon I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
__Sheldon I'm currently single.
__Sheldon I understand we're no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
__Amy What baby?
__Howard Why are marine biologists always so cute?
__Leonard Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
__Sheldon But enough about the Czech Republic. Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't. And yet Romania gets dumped. I'll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
__Sheldon You saw through that one, did you?
__Sheldon She watched it. I'm gonna get that girl back.
__Howard Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
__Penny You really didn't have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
__Bernadette Good for you.
__Penny Uh, no, not yet. There's still a few people I haven't told personally.
__Bernadette It's understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
__Raj There's got to be a smarter way of removing it.
__Leonard Let's see, a lever, a lever.
__Sheldon What if that burning food attracts animals?
__Penny Oh, we're glad you had fun.
__Bernadette Of course.
__Bernadette Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.
__Howard How could Archie defeat Predator?
__Penny Hang on. Wait, you actually think it's 2003?
__Raj With pleasure.
__Sheldon Or worse, up.
__Sheldon Excuse me, Barry?
__Leonard When was your honour insulted?
__Sheldon How dare you.
__Amy Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
__Raj How many sips of that beer did he have?
__Penny Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
__Sheldon Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.
__Leonard Just tell me.
__Leonard What are we going to do?
__Barry Sowwy, there's a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.
__Howard If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.
__Bernadette He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.
__Stuart Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don't, thumbs down.
__Sheldon Uh, but this is violating university code.
__Bernadette We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing what's out there.
__Sheldon Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.
__Sheldon Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away?
__Sheldon Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you're only limited by your imagination.
__Leonard Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.
__Amy No, it, it's not like that.
__Adam What was it about Spock that appealed to you?
__Sheldon When there was no more room in the floor safe.
__Raj That is so generous of you. I'd like to switch sides.
__Howard That's not true at all. I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me. I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.
__Leonard No.
__Howard That would be nice.
__Raj I don't know if I'd say you… oh.
__Penny What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny Your what?
__Leonard Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?
__Bernadette We got to get out of here.
__Penny Oh, no.
__Vanessa Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.
__Siri Here are some images of naked grandma butts.
__Bernadette You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
__Bernadette The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.
__Howard Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
__Penny Yep. What's the code?
__Penny Uh.
__Penny I'm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
__Penny OMG. OMG. We're so close to the new Star Wars. I can't take it. Gah. Gah?
__Sheldon How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where'd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I'm getting kind of hungry.
__Sheldon I believe you. I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
__Elon And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.
__Amy Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.
__Sheldon Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
__Sheldon There was a project I've been thinking about starting.
__Amy It is?
__Bernadette ‘Cause it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.
__Raj He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.
__Leonard What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
__Sheldon No, I can't. I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.
__Sheldon Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.
__Penny Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?
__Bernadette Well, we're really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…
__Leonard Yeah, the wait is finally over.
__Penny Have fun, guys.
__Man Star Trek stinks!
__Leonard No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.
__Sheldon Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.
__Amy Uh, please tell me what to say next.
__Dr Gallo Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn't sure if he was real.
__Penny I do. You know, Leonard's right. Talking to you is really helping.
__Sheldon I miss you as well.
__Sheldon Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.
__Sheldon You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.
__Sheldon No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.
__Sheldon Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.
__Leonard What are you doing?
__Sheldon Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.
__Sheldon Meemaw. I'm so happy to see you.
__Sheldon No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It's not my fault she died when you were four.
__Raj It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.
__Raj Yeah, I get that. I'm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.
__Howard Really? You don't think she's attractive?
__Sheldon Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.
__Sheldon And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.
__Claire I didn't ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.
__Raj Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
__Meemaw Young lady, if you think I don't know what it's like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you're wrong. ‘Cause that was my husband.
__Raj You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?
__Penny Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?
__Penny Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let's get out of here.
__Amy Your friend is hurting.
__Leonard Well, glad you're feeling better.
__Penny Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
__Barry Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?
__Amy Now?
__Penny Yes.
__Bernadette If you're really worried, we'll take him to the vet and have him tested.
__Barry Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.
__Leonard Ready to play when you are.
__Leonard What's going on?
__Penny No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat. You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.
__Bernadette Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out…
__Penny No.
__Amy I do know what that's like. I really do.
__Howard If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.
__Amy Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
__Sheldon Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
__Sheldon I know that you worked hard to put this together. I'm sorry I'm ruining it.
__Howard Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we've known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.
__Leslie Happy birthday, dumbass.
__Attorney Come on in, fellas.
__Howard Seventy-five percent?
__Howard We can't. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.
__Claire So if you were still interested.
__Claire Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to any more?
__Raj Hey, Emily, listen, I've been thinking, and I'm not sure it's a good idea that I come over.
__Amy I didn't understand your e-mail.
__Sheldon What?
__Howard Well, hang on. What movie is it?
__Raj Hey. Where are the guys?
__Sheldon Well, oh, it's just a, it's a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the hockey puck dent.
__Sheldon It ends with dinosaurs. I'm sorry if you think less of me.
__Amy That's me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm, I'm here for you.
__Bernadette Yes and yes.
__Bernadette It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.
__Raj Hello.
__Leonard To be fair, good at both.
__Leonard If that's what you want to do, yes.
__Penny Well, it's not what I want to do.
__Sheldon Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.
__Leonard I thought you were back with Emily.
__Sheldon You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
__Sheldon And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it's pretty cool, isn't it?
__Penny Really? The only adult?
__Amy Well, I get why he's annoyed.
__Amy Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.
__Amy You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Sorry?
__Howard Well, she did. And human resources.
__Leonard From Amy.
__Bernadette Why are you dressed like that?
__Sheldon Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.
__Sheldon They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.
__Leonard That sounds fun.
__Amy Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.
__Penny Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
__Raj Funny how that worked out.
__Raj No, I'm still dating her.
__Raj Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.
__Claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don't like me? What if they like me and I don't like them?
__Leonard Hey.
__Leonard I smell nothing.
__Zack Huh. You sure you guys are smart?
__Sheldon You're gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
__Sheldon Ready?
__Howard You got something better?
__Leonard I don't think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.
__Howard Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
__Sheldon Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.
__Penny Yes.
__Penny More specific.
__Sheldon All right, back to learning.
__Penny Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
__Leonard Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.
__Raj Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
__Stuart Consider it my way of getting more of your money.
__Amy Oh, sure. I'll, I'll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.
__Penny Come on, it'll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn't invite her to the first one.
__Penny Hey, look, then forget about her, let's do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.
__Amy My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.
__Raj No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.
__Alfred Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.
__Beverly Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.
__Alfred Yes. Yes, I'm an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
__Sheldon Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.
__Wyatt Anyway, we're here, slugger.
__Beverley I can't wait for this day to be over.
__Mary That's enough.
__Penny Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
__Beverley Hello.
__Alfred Yes, I am. I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused.
__Sheldon You made God sad today, Mom.
__Raj You know that hurts my feelings.
__Raj Okay.
__ Oh.
__Leonard Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.
__Marty Well, I don't know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don't sign anything.
__Sheldon That's what you said.
__Marty Howard, why is he yelling at me?
__Penny Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.
__Colonel Williams Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Bernadette I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
__Leonard Oh, my turn, my turn.
__Sheldon One o'clock? I'm not a raccoon.
__The Flash Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.
__The Flash You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.
__Howard Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?
__Bert It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.
__Leonard Seriously?
__Leonard It's okay, we'll figure something out.
__Amy Seriously?
__Howard Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
__Sheldon You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
__Amy Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
__Penny Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.
__Sheldon Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?
__Amy Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.
__Sheldon Great.
__Amy Do you want to go to our place and make out?
__Penny The new neighbours are weird.
__Sheldon She's always complaining about people at work.
__Amy You're not making me feel better.
__Penny Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
__ one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.
__Sheldon That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
__Howard It's called relaxing, and that's all you need to know.
__Raj You coming?
__Howard You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
__Amy Oh. Really?
__Bernadette Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
__Guy It has got to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.
__Stuart Nice to meet you.
__Penny Here you go.
__Penny Yeah, he really is.
__Sheldon This is it. You are the practice round.
__Sheldon Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I'm glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.
__Howard You're right. It sells itself.
__Raj The Animated Series. Your favourite.
__Bert It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.
__Amy We're so sorry.
__Sheldon Well, no, that's not true. I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali. But we're not supposed to say that 'cause he's a minority.
__Sheldon Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out.
__Sheldon Hmm?
__Howard And how single are you right now?
__Leonard Uh, no.
__Sheldon Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.
__Amy I guess it's okay. I'm sorry that I lied about my apartment.
__Penny Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.
__Sheldon Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don't even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn't even end in dena.
__Penny Do you really mean that?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Amy I understand. I'll leave you be.
__ expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.
__Bernadette Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.
__Raj That's wonderful. A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common.
__Raj Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, I'm very busy, too.
__Penny Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
__Raj Uh.
__Raj Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.
__Raj It's my one move.
__Amy Anybody else want to try? I'm gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
__Sheldon I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.
__Bert Great. Now that we're friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?
__Sheldon How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
__Sheldon What happened to them?
__Leonard Well, you know what's gonna happen, he's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.
__Sheldon For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?
__Sheldon Yeah, take whatever you want.
__Leonard Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it.
__Stuart You just kick back and relax, I've got it all under control.
__Strange old man I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.
__Leonard Sheldon, get out here.
__Theodore Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking. Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you're in a new phase of your lives and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.
__Sheldon I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.
__Stuart Meet you outside in 2 minutes.
__Howard I love you.
__Raj Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language.
__Sheldon No, and also, I don't want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, it's your birthday. I can soldier through this.
__Amy Stop talking about trains.
__Stuart Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I'll go get some more.
__Leonard Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.
__Amy Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
__Sheldon Well, I was in my room, I couldn't hear what they were saying.
__ Flashback.
__Leonard Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
__ Stupid idea.
__Penny There's no shame in asking for a break.
__Bernadette It's been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
__Howard I mean, it's Stuart. Maybe she's playing possum until he goes away.
__Leonard Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.
__Bernadette Yeah, go ahead.
__Penny Pink wine and pizza bagels? It's like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny I hadn't really thought about it.
__Leonard Well, hey, come on, just tell me.
__Leonard What do you say?
