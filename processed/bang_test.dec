__Leonard Excuse me?
__Sheldon Not with commentary.
__Leonard Yes, and you've never met one of them.
__Leonard Uh, yes.
__Sheldon Oh, come on. Who hasn't seen this differential below “here I sit broken hearted?”
__Leonard No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.
__Penny Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Leonard The hair products are Sheldon's.
__Leonard We're not going to give up just like that.
__Sheldon From the intercom.
__Sheldon Well you got me out of my pants.
__Sheldon They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
__Sheldon Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.
__Leonard So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.
__Leonard Penny, wait.
__Penny A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?
__Leonard Men do things for women without expecting sex.
__Leonard I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.
__Sheldon Excuse me, but I think we've both found that helpful at times.
__Leonard It's a joke.
__Raj Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.
__Leonard Um, here's the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie's discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….
__Sheldon Check.
__Leonard Dammit man, we're dying here.
__Howard Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?
__Leonard Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.
__Sheldon Okay.
__Leonard You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.
__Leonard I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one… glorious summer.
__Sheldon Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I'd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
__Sheldon Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
__Sheldon In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”
__Leonard Like luminous fish.
__Sheldon Shhhhh!
__Leonard Oh.
__Gablehouser Dr Cooper.
__Mrs Cooper Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.
__Sheldon I got my job back.
__Leonard Really? What happened?
__Sheldon Statistically unlikely.
__Sheldon Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?
__Lesley Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.
__Penny Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.
__Sheldon Well, there's Leonard.  And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930's gangster.
__Sheldon Oh, that is so… so…
__Lesley Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?
__Leonard Sorry.
__Sheldon Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?
__Penny Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.
__Leonard No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.
__Leonard There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
__Penny Leonard, are you okay.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.
__Raj Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.
__Leonard Great idea.
__Penny Why?
__Sheldon This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.
__Leonard I guess for you that's an option.
__Penny Thanks.
__Penny You can keep that too.
__Howard chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka
__Sheldon No more talking, everybody go.
__Waiter Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
__Penny Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.
__Sheldon It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.
__Leonard Who are you calling?
__Howard Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
__Christie And this is Christie Van Der Bell.
__Sheldon I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
__Howard Guess whose parents just got broadband.
__Leonard Yeah, we're not like Haroun and Tanweer!
__Leonard It's amazing.
__Raj Back off Sheldon.
__Sheldon Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.
__Raj Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.
__Leonard Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.
__Sheldon Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.
__Sheldon I know. I read it before I threw it out.
__Penny If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your… your only tie?
__Leonard Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
__Sheldon Excuse me, little idea?
__Leonard You're right, this side does look better.
__Penny No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained.
__Howard It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.
__Penny I really should have brought my own car.
__Leonard You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.
__Leonard Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
__Sheldon So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath.
__Leonard That would have hurt her feelings.
__Sheldon Why?
__Sheldon Oh, alright. Leonard.
__Leonard How?
__Penny Well imagine how I'm feeling.
__Sheldon No, I made him up. I think you'd call him Lee.
__Leonard Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.
__Leonard So he goes back into rehab?
__Leonard Oh, another hug, thank you.
__Sheldon It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.
__Man I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.
__Penny Hi guys.
__Penny Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.
__Penny I… I don't…
__Penny Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.
__Leonard I tried to stop you.
__Sheldon Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.
__Howard I'm not going in there.
__Leonard Then just say go straight.
__Howard Oh, I guess you didn't.
__Leonard Hi!
__Sheldon I want grilled cheese.
__Sheldon Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.
__Leonard A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.
__Leonard No kidding, you speak English really well.
__Dennis Do I look like I lift weights.
__Leonard Not heavy ones.
__Dennis Have you considered it?
__Sheldon No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
__Sheldon Are you sure?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Raj Okay. How about that one.
__Sheldon Welcome Dennis Kim.
__Leonard Yeah, mission accomplished.
__Raj You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
__Leonard Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour….
__Sheldon Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.
__Penny Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.
__Penny Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon It's on, bitch.
__Leonard There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.
__Gablehouser AA, I need your official answer.
__Howard Oh, that's cool.
__Howard If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.
__Sheldon Yeah.
__Sheldon Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too.
__Sheldon But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up.
__Leonard Don't worry baby, I've got you.
__Sheldon She's my twin sister, she thinks she's funny but frankly I've never been able to see it.
__Howard Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny.
__Missy And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
__Sheldon Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
__Leonard Those are not mine.
__Leonard Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall… and perfect.
__Penny Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?
__Sheldon I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.
__Sheldon Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.
__Leonard Because she's your sister.
__Howard You want to go again? Let's go.
__ We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.
__Missy Come on, Shelly.  I want you to know I'm very proud of you.
__Sheldon I'm a theoretical physicist.
__Penny Shuddup, yeah you do.
__Penny That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
__Howard Don't ask.
__Penny Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.
__Penny I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.
__Penny No?
__Howard No, listen, see we're throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.
__Nurse Is that all you need?
__Howard No, it's Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon.
__Howard Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel.
__Penny Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.
__Leonard I'm pretty sure I never said that.
__Penny No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own.
__Penny Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.
__Penny Sheldon, what's the point?
__Penny Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard.
__Sheldon Then don't.
__Leonard No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
__Sheldon Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.
__Sheldon I said Good Day!
__Sheldon Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen's trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it's ultimately circular, i.e., I'm moving out because I'm moving out.
__Leonard Where are you gonna live?
__Voice Strippergram.
__Leonard What's with him?
__Penny He told you?
__Penny Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.
__Raj H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.
__Leonard Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
__Leonard You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
__Sheldon You want me to leave the apartment?
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Well then don't order popcorn.
__Penny Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.
__Leslie Me too. You're sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
__Sheldon Fascinating.
__Leonard Oh yeah.
__Penny Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?
__Penny Oh, sonofabitch!
__Sheldon I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.
__Sheldon Level three and she thinks she's rich! What a noob.
__ Hi!
__Sheldon They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.
__Raj I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
__Sheldon Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you're not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can't log on and help you. We'll talk when I get home.  I'm not getting the computing time, am I?
__Leonard Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
__Leonard Penny's been keeping him up at night.
__Sheldon Would you like to be?
__Sheldon Drink a healing potion.
__Raj Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.
__Leonard Well, we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
__Leonard Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren't very supportive.
__Howard You were a colossal ass-hat.
__Leonard Come on.
__Raj Oh, I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.
__Raj I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?
__Leonard Terrific.
__Howard I'll lend you my user name, it's wealthybigpenis.
__Howard It can't be racist, he's a beloved character on the Simpsons.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon That's Northwest Texas, I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
__Sheldon Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I'm not insane, my mother had me tested.
__Dr Koothrappali Look, Rajesh, I understand, you're in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don't want it for a steady diet.
__Raj Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you'd excuse me, I have to go throw up.
__Penny I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
__Leonard I'm not going to work.
__Leonard Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights, and that you'd have to make other arrangements.
__Sheldon I didn't try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
__Penny Do you have any alcohol?
__Leonard Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
__Sheldon Ooh!
__Sheldon Hmmmm?
__Penny Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
__Sheldon Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it's amazingly detailed.
__Leonard So wait,you're just gonna give up?
__Leonard Well, since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment.
__Leonard Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
__Sheldon Yes. Apparently I'm getting a free dinner.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
__Leonard Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
__Sheldon Not in these pants.
__Ramona Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.
__Sheldon So we can communicate through the wall.
__Sheldon Shh! Ramona's sleeping on the couch.
__Sheldon I'm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
__Leonard Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
__Sheldon I'm just so… full.
__Sheldon What's wrong with your TV?
__Howard And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
__Raj Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
__Sheldon Dill slices, not sweet?
__Leonard I asked.
__Leonard No.
__Penny I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?
__Sheldon The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
__Leonard Are you insane? You're not going to party with them, you're not even going to get anywhere near that place.
__Sheldon Why?
__Sheldon I've done no stupid things.
__Penny What's this?
__Howard I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she's here. She doesn't exactly have clearance.
__Leonard Okay.
__Girl You're not gonna see me now.
__Howard Okay.
__Sheldon Doesn't anyone want to know where he's going?
__ Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
__Howard We're not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!
__Penny Nice.
__Leonard Oh, hey, guys.
__Penny Please don't do that.
__Penny Oh, all right. S'u'up?
__Leonard I stand corrected.
__Leonard Uh, Sheldon?
__Leonard Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting “Ha!”)
__Sheldon Penny. Zucchini bread.
__Steph Hi.
__Steph Hey, how's my big cry baby?
__Penny Leonard, congratulations.
__Steph I Seriously doubt it.
__Sheldon See? She's not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
__Steph Uh, hello.
__Steph Bye.
__Steph Why not?
__Leonard Good.
__Leonard Um, little bit.  What?
__Leonard Huh.
__Penny Hiney?
__Computer voice Honey.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Howard I know. It's funny when it's not happening to us.
__Penny Oh, is it okay?
__Leonard I'm not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don't take melanoma lightly.
__Penny Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
__Penny Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
__Penny Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
__Penny Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
__Raj All right, what's next?
__Leonard He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
__Leonard Okay, don't take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.
__Penny Oh, it's cute.
__Raj Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.
__Raj Feel better now?
__Leonard Hey Kripke.
__Leonard I don't know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
__Penny Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
__Sheldon Hi Rebecca, I'm your new friend, Sheldon.
__Sheldon This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.
__Together Oh…
__Howard Guilty as charged. I'm out.
__Penny Penny.
__Sheldon The problem appears to be unsolvable.
__Leonard We've got to be missing something. Let's start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
__Sheldon Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.
__Leonard It's, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.
__Penny Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.
__Leonard But if you're ever short, there's always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern's ass.
__Penny Oh, that's nothing.
__Leonard Did he pay you back?
__Penny Why not?
__Leonard Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
__Sheldon This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.
__Woman Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.
__Beverley If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.
__Leonard Yes.
__Beverley Steeped three minutes?
__Beverley Two-percent milk?
__Beverley Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.
__Beverley I'm sorry, it's on my other laptop.
__Sheldon You're clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.
__Beverley Oh, I'll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.
__Leonard Right. Ah! Where's the lime?  Oh, okay, we're sharing.
__Beverley Only when you're in a CAT scanner.
__Leonard Come on, you're trying to have sex with your father, and I'm okay with that.
__Leonard She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey's “Any Way You Want It” on Rock Star.)
__Beverley That's not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes
__Sheldon No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I'm done.
__Leonard Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
__Howard Oh, there's the arrhythmia.
__Leonard Wackadoodle.
__Penny No. Not at all.
__Howard When did that happen?
__Howard Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don't go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?
__Howard Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!
__Sheldon What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
__Sheldon But once you open the box, you've voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we've entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.
__Sheldon George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.
__Leonard So?
__Summer You're making that up.
__Summer Is that so?
__Summer Uh-huh.
__Sheldon So, Penny has a don't knock on my door before eleven o'clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.
__Sheldon When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I'm fully indemnified and no longer liable.
__Sheldon Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.
__Sheldon No, Of course you're not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.
__Sheldon All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.
__Howard And I'll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
__Howard They didn't quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.
__Leonard What?
__Leonard Yeah, it is.
__Sheldon Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?
__Leonard What's wrong?
__Alicia But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.
__Penny Okay, lady, you are way out of line.
__Raj So what are we going to do tonight?
__Raj The Wolowitz Coefficient?
__Leonard Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos. Stuart's a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
__Howard It's my comic book!
__Sheldon Leonard, we need a ruling.
__Penny That's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?
__Leonard Hey, Howard?
__Leonard Do you…?  Let's go.
__Raj Why?
__Stuart It's okay. She thinks she has decaf.
__Sheldon That's preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered, I just don't see it.
__Raj What are you going to tell your mother?
__Howard First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.
__Leonard That's not an email, that's Leslie's facebook page.
__Raj Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
__Penny Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?
__Sheldon Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Nobody wants that.
__Penny He's very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
__Sheldon Aren't you going to check your messages?
__Howard It's gonna fail after about ten flushes.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.
__Leonard I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
__Leonard Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I'm gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
__Leonard I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
__Penny What's classified?
__Sheldon It doesn't say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
__Sheldon That's 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going, but I can't know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
__Sheldon Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
__Raj We could play outside.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Penny Sheldon.
__Sheldon No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
__Leonard I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
__Sheldon Okay, Leonard, I know you're concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.
__Leonard Yeah, that's very comforting.
__Leonard All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
__Leonard Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn't have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it's no big deal.
__Kripke Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.
__Penny Are you serious?
__Leonard It's actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on…
__Leonard Maybe you can.
__Leonard Why does it have to get weird?
__Sheldon Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we'd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
__Sheldon Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
__Leonard Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you've really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
__Raj What's that?
__Prof Crawley Couldn't wait, huh?
__Prof Crawley Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.
__Sheldon Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
__Penny Okay, forget the chicken.
__Sheldon Have I crossed some sort of line again?
__Sheldon I want oatmeal.
__Leonard Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. Ooh, Penny, it's as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.
__Sheldon Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate
__Penny Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
__Sheldon Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?
__Sheldon Did you? I didn't notice. Have a chocolate.
__Leonard No, you're not sanding Penny.
__Bethany I work at the Gap.
__Raj With my luck, hepatitis
__Tattooist That's just rubbing alcohol.
__Penny What?
__Leonard Really, that's a lot of work, and it's kind of late.
__Raj I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?
__Raj And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.
__Raj Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?
__Leonard We're watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
__Leonard So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?
__Sheldon Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.
__Sheldon For me. You're going to have to listen more carefully when you're on the job.
__Raj Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.
__Howard Top o' the mornin'o ya!
__Howard Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It's the perfect meal for apres l'amour.
__Penny Get him, bring him back.
__Sheldon Nevertheless, I didn't say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.
__Raj For you or with you?
__Sheldon Wait, you have to drive me home.
__Leonard Because when I made that agreement, I didn't think I'd ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
__Penny I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
__Sheldon Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.
__Howard What?
__Sheldon Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames!
__Howard And I said you could study me 'cause I'm a tiny living thing. It's a joke.
__Leonard Gonna be a long night.
__Bernadette I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
__Howard Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.
__Wil Wheaton Underworld guardian.
__Penny Well, 'cause they're not genius scientists.
__Leonard Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren't geniuses. My point is, if we're going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
__Raj It's not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don't have a shot with them.
__Leonard Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It'll be fun.
__Howard Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.
__Howard Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it's… okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let's go.
__Sheldon I'm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.
__Leonard Who is this Justin?
__Leonard The two aren't mutually exclusive!
__Leonard No, we just had a little spat.
__Penny E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.
__Penny Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
__Howard Okay, sorry.
__Raj You brought your mother into this!
__Penny Is Leonard coming?
__Sheldon Right now would be good.
__Penny It doesn't matter why he told me. It's true, isn't it?
__Raj I don't care! And why don't you think I can find a woman for myself?
__Howard's Mother Howard' I can't! I'm on the toilet!
__Stuart Is everything okay?
__Penny He's a musician. He'll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.
__Howard Ooh, Real Sex.
__Howard Alright, let's see what's on the east coast feed.
__Leonard Oh, hey. Dune.
__Leonard Too bad Sheldon couldn't come with us.
__Penny Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!
__Sheldon Shall I come back at a better time?
__Penny What?
__Howard Stars are pretty, aren't they?
__Sheldon Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.
__Penny All right, can we please go?
__Sheldon Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
__Leonard With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.
__Sheldon Yes. Look this over and tell me what's unclear to you.
__Raj That's true. He didn't just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham's water supply.
__Penny Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
__Penny Shoes for Less.
__Leonard Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we're testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
__Sheldon Yes. Leonard's work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, I'm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.
__Penny Um, actually, can we do it in private?
__Sheldon Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it's a warm summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?
__Howard's Mother Howard' What's great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?
__Penny Oh, God, Sheldon, look I'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
__Bernadette What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?
__Leonard I drove, Mother. I'm driving now.
__Sheldon My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
__Leonard Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
__Howard What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
__Howard If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.
__Beverley Mmm, well, let's see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?
__Sheldon Oh, is it? We're conversing. Checkmate.
__Beverley What?
__Penny Oh, thank you, Beverly.
__Sheldon Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.
__Raj Race riots?
__Penny Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
__Howard Why don't you kids go ahead and chat? We're gonna make out back here.
__Sheldon And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.
__Raj Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.
__Girl Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?
__Sheldon We scored. I'm the wingman.
__Leonard Laser.
__Sheldon Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It's all right. They didn't take my comic books.
__Sheldon Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!  Leonard and Penny!
__Sheldon What if someone steals my keys?
__Penny Raj, your car is blocking me… (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words “Intruder Alert”) What the hell?
__Raj But if I don't eat my lima beans, I can't have my cookie.
__Leonard Don't tell Koothrappali. After you.
__Howard Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
__Leonard No, that's a crazy thing.
__Sheldon Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child's play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.
__Assistant Good.
__Assistant Do you have your own car?
__Sheldon I'm trying to get these tables cleared. We're slammed.
__Penny You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
__Sheldon You're right. That is more menial. Hello, I'm Sheldon. I'll be your server today. I don't recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.
__Sheldon Nope.
__Penny Sheldon, where are you going? Aren't you going to clean this up?
__Leonard Who's miserable and alone?
__Sheldon I'd be much further along if I'd been allowed to practice.
__Leonard Why are you doing this?
__Sheldon Heated to 180 degrees?
__Penny No, it isn't.
__Penny Mmm, no, it isn't.
__Sheldon Howard?
__Sheldon And who performed that heroic act?
__Leonard So tell him to apologize.
__Sheldon That's the toilet?
__Sheldon Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.
__Penny What kind of deal?
__Penny Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.
__Raj Huh? That'll come off.
__Howard You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.
__Leonard You always get your way.
__Sheldon Looking for something?
__Leonard I'm not letting go, you let go.
__ (They begin to struggle, both shouting “give it”, “give it to me” and “it's mine” at various intervals. Penny gets out of the bed and heads out the door.)
__Howard Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.
__Penny Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, 'cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.
__Sheldon That's what my sister used to say.
__Sheldon Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
__Sheldon Thank you, Leonard.
__Leonard Uh-uh, give it a minute.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Leonard Yeah, probably.
__Sheldon Of course they are. Leonard's being one.
__Raj Did you start waxing?
__ Yes!
__Sheldon If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.
__Sheldon And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
__Wil Yeah, would have been kinder.
__Leonard Penny, you're up.
__Sheldon Well, of course I'm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!
__Howard I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
__Raj I've missed you.
__Woman's voice Woman' Here Bubbles. Here boy.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Leonard Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
__Raj You really think so?
__Raj But we'll have sex first, right?
__Sheldon I got lost.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that's been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?
__Leonard Fine. I'll take him for shoes next Saturday.
__Leonard Come on. It's just a cup of coffee.
__Sheldon Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
__Sheldon Well, she doesn't care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don't open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one's wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?
__Raj When can I sit with you again?
__Sheldon Oh, good grief. This isn't about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.
__Leonard Look, it's you.
__Leonard Sure.
__Leonard Morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I'm going to relieve myself.
__Raj Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.
__Howard He's right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
__Raj Okay, show of hands. Who's up for this?
__Leonard Yeah, I wanted to explain.
__Sheldon This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
__Penny Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
__Past Leonard What?
__Man Run fast, run far.
__Past Sheldon I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?
__Past Sheldon Why don't you let me do this.
__Past Leonard Oh, good. I passed the barriers.
__Past Sheldon I'm just going to keep knocking till you answer.  Leonard?  Leonard?  Leonard?
__Joyce Kim That's it! I'm out of here!
__Past Sheldon But you didn't notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.
__Past Leonard We can fix that. Let's leave.
__Penny Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
__Leonard Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
__Sheldon I would hardly call that dialogue!
__Penny I'm sorry, what?
__Penny Oh, right.
__Leonard Let me explain what we're doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
__Sheldon See, now this is a man for Penny.
__Leonard Where are we going?
__Leonard How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
__Howard And that's exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating”
__Howard Raj and I entered Sheldon's information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Howard I'm guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
__Sheldon I can't date Amy.
__Penny Probably not.
__Amy Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
__Sheldon I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?
__Sheldon Muggles.
__Leonard How about an acetylene torch?
__Sheldon My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.
__Sheldon I should think so.
__Penny I did not have sex with 31 guys.
__Sheldon A hybrid dog and octopus. Man's underwater best friend.
__Leonard How can you walk around with no money?
__Sheldon Certainly. I've run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
__Howard You're right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.
__Penny Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
__Penny Oh, Sheldon!
__Leonard Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
__Leonard Except in Knight Rider, the car isn't a yammering sphincter.
__Sheldon-bot Sheldon- You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn't survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
__Leonard Why? What's the problem?
__Penny Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.
__Sheldon In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?
__Sheldon You're in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?
__Leonard What?
__Penny I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
__Howard And someday, when you have varicose veins, I'll show you how to massage them.
__Howard More like Yoko and Yoko.
__Amy I'm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
__Howard We're all a little worried about Sheldon.
__Leonard Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you're feeling with this breakup.
__Sheldon You didn't break up, she dumped you.
__Mrs Cooper Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.
__Katee Sackhoff Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?
__Raj But I can't have one.
__Howard Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all we could get back together?
__Raj One more time?
__Raj Knock yourself out.
__Howard Oh, no, that's okay. How have you been?
__Penny It's passion fruit, new on the menu.
__Bernadette I know. I work here.
__Howard What do you mean, whose fault was that?
__Bernadette Really.
__Raj It's not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.
__Leonard Got it.
__Leonard Because I don't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon Screwed.
__Leonard The volcano thing? No.
__Leonard You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
__Leonard Okay, where are you?
__Girl Hi. Sorry I'm late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.
__Joy Aah! Time's up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I'm hilarious.
__Raj I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.
__Howard Let's just agree they're both hot.
__Leonard Hmm, Priya's not back yet? Well, I guess that's not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
__Raj Uh, my plans with Priya.
__Leonard You've really got to get out more.
__Sheldon Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don't have the sword. Good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me.
__Leonard Drop axe.
__Sheldon Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?
__Leonard What do you want.
__Sheldon You've asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I've provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn't have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.
__Sheldon The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.
__Sheldon I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?
__Howard And as long as we're talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard's food.
__Leonard Well, uh, I can't believe you used Sheldon's toothbrush.
__Sheldon Well, sure.
__Raj I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
__Sheldon Who knows? I haven't watched any scary movies recently. I'm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it's been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
__Sheldon Alcohol.
__Penny Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
__Sheldon I wronged Howard, and he won't accept my apology.
__Penny Kirk cheated.
__Sheldon See? Howard's on my side.
__Sheldon And here's where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.
__Amy Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
__Amy Pillow fight!
__Raj Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats.
__Sheldon I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I'm a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?
__Theatre staff ‘Cause I'm the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.
__Leonard A big kiss. On the mouth.
__Howard Yeah. This man is not my father. I'm being held hostage. So I'm going to do something insane in the hopes that you'll call 911.
__Penny Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.
__Penny Love you, too.
__ Well, then, what do you want?
__Howard Nope. He's gone.
__Wyatt Oh, look at that baby. They're really biting, huh?
__Wyatt I'll get to you in a minute.
__Leonard I'll give it a shot.
__Leonard Great.
__Amy Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.
__Raj All right, I will.
__Amy Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
__Sheldon Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.
__Penny I'm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy's urges?
__Penny Okay, we should, we should go.
__Zack Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.
__Raj What the hell did I do?
__Sheldon Milk Dud?
__Leonard Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He's a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
__Stuart So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?
__All Seven, six…
__Sheldon This is my moment, dag nab it!
__Penny Hang on. Let's see where he's going.
__Raj Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
__Sheldon Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother's birthday is coming up. I'm going to need you to pick up a present.
__Leonard No.
__Sheldon All right, let's get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.
__Howard Fine. Let's say it together.
__Leonard Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
__Sheldon Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
__Sheldon Probably going to have to throw them away.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.
__Leonard What's he doing in your apartment?
__Penny Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.
__Leonard Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
__Penny Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
__Howard Still right behind you.
__Sheldon Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.
__Sheldon Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
__Bernadette Oh, my God, Glenn!
__Amy Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
__Penny Oh, good. Hey.
__Amy Of course, we're best friends.
__Penny We're just gonna have to make the best of this.
__Raj I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
__Penny Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.
__Sheldon I'd like a frozen yogurt, please.
__Bernadette Did you hear? Isn't it terrible?
__Howard Shh, shh. Listen to me. I'm not gonna make it.
__Raj What?
__Raj You are my heart!
__Leonard He's tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
__Amy Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.
__Howard It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.
__ Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don't, I, I really don't know why. Tonight? Sure, that'd be great. Okay, I'll, I'll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
__Sheldon An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?
__Leonard Well, wherever we're going, she's sending a car to pick me up.
__Leonard Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
__Bernadette Howard, have you ever considered us living together?
__Howard Look at us planning a future together.
__Sheldon Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.
__Howard There's no room. His sister is staying with him.
__Howard Isn't that great?
__Priya I'd love that.
__Bernadette I can't believe this.
__Amy Wise.
__Sheldon Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I'll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack and TV's LeVar Burton.
__Amy Yo, P-dog.
__Amy You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
__Howard Cheers. You realize that's the first time we've ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it's called a toast?
__Bernadette What's that?
__Bernadette Oh, God, that is so romantic.
__Amy Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.
__Priya Sleep okay?
__Leonard Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?
__Priya If you had them on now, you could see what we're going to do next.
__Raj Okay.
__Howard Is that your card?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
__Sheldon This deck is rigged in some fashion.
__Penny You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone. Not that anybody asked.
__Penny Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?
__Leonard Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin's observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
__Priya So did you get to talk to Penny?
__Leonard Nope.
__Leonard Whatcha doin'?
__Priya Why didn't you wear your contacts? Don't you like them?
__Raj Okay.
__Howard Three of clubs. (It isn't)
__Leonard I don't listen for it, but it's nice to know everything's okay with your plumbing. The building's plumbing.
__Sheldon I hate you.
__Leonard Thank you, officer.
__Howard So, how do you guys want to play this?
__Howard And me.
__Raj Oh, guess who.
__Raj Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?
__Sheldon This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
__Leonard Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?
__Leonard Really? Who?
__Leonard Wow, that's hard to believe.
__Raj Fair enough. Now, what's up with Clarinet? Bernadette!
__Sheldon If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.
__Amy By all means.
__Amy I should think so. That's gold.
__Amy Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
__Sheldon Hey.
__Raj This is it.
__Amy Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
__Amy You smell like baby powder.
__Penny That's too many S's for kissing.
__Sheldon I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.
__Leonard Why would I want to do that?
__Sheldon Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?
__Penny Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.
__Amy Don't worry. I'll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
__Sheldon It's what I do. But wait, there's more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.
__Leonard And what?
__Sheldon You know I'm right.
__Amy Oh, my metatarsal are barking.
__Penny Wh… What the hell did she say?
__Priya Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?
__Bernadette In the bathroom.
__Bernadette It was an architect!
__Howard Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
__Leonard Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, this is a nightmare!
__Raj Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon's turning up the heat.
__Mrs Wolowitz I'm in the toilet.
__Penny What are you doing at work these days?
__Penny Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.
__Penny It's just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
__Raj You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.
__Priya Oh, God, that's so true.
__Leonard Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't.
__Leonard Bernadette, that's great. Howard, do you make a buttload?
__Sheldon All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard's bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.
__Raj Sheldon doesn't get along with Sheldon. It's still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
__Raj When did you take my blood?
__Penny I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.
__Raj Please, come in.
__Leonard That's so nice.
__Amy I'll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
__Penny Thank you.
__Penny So, we didn't actually…
__Penny Yeah.
__Sheldon Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn't your fault, it's mine. I haven't earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.
__Sheldon When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.
__Priya I miss you.
__Penny It's great, isn't it?
__Sheldon I've been sitting in garbage!
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Name one time I've ever done that.
__Leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You're a, you're a, you're a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
__Leonard Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
__Amy Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
__Sheldon Is not. Is not, is not.
__Raj I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.
__Amy No, he didn't.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Mmmmmm.
__Bernadette Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?
__Howard Only when it's fatty. Well, don't be jealous, babe. Someday you'll get to cut it for me.
__Mrs Wolowitz Let me know when you're done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!
__Leonard I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while.
__Sheldon I did. How was yours?
__Sheldon What exactly do you mean by that?
__Bernadette He didn't try them yet!
__Raj No, it's just that everybody's got someone. Sheldon's with Amy, Howard's getting married, you're dating my sister.
__Bernadette Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he's in the placebo group.
__Penny Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?
__Raj What are you doing?
__Penny You're kidding.
__Leonard Could you tell us?
__Penny Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn't dated a whole lot of women. And I'm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I'm saying.
__Stuart Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
__Leonard So?
__Sheldon It's part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
__Stuart ‘Cause there wasn't last time.
__Wil There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.
__Penny Wait, what is going on?
__All Wow.
__Bernadette Just stop talking, Howard.
__Howard This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
__Howard Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
__Howard I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.
__Penny Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.
__Bernadette Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
__Sheldon Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.
__Brent Sixteen.
__Mrs Cooper It's called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.
__Sheldon And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can'tmake your mother fry it.
__Mrs Cooper That's better. Now tell me what's bothering you.
__Mrs Cooper Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'. What do we do when someone's hurtin'?
__Penny Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.
__Mrs Cooper I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?
__Leonard I hadn't…
__Sheldon No, I'm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.
__Raj Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We've got to get you to bed.
__Mrs Cooper Of course.
__Sheldon Yours.
__Leonard Well, you know, it's Comic Con. I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats.
__Leonard Okay, we used to go out, right?
__Amy It's hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.
__Leonard Come on, it's your turn. We said we'd get more fresh air.
__Sheldon Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.
__Sheldon She sounds weepy. I don't like weepy. Let's go.
__Sheldon And that made you feel sad?
__Howard I'll tell you later.
__Leonard Amy, what are you doing here?
__Sheldon I'm begging both of you, please, let's go.
__Penny I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
__Penny Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.
__Leonard Too casual?
__Penny You're kidding.
__Howard I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
__Penny Uh, no, thanks.
__Penny So have you written anything I might have seen?
__Penny No, I'm talking to him because he's cute.
__Penny Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.
__Bernadette Oh, it's just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.
__Amy If you're keeping him, I've got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.
__Penny Okay, don't judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?
__Howard Very.
__Leonard We should go easy on him. Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
__Leonard It's you.
__Sheldon And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?
__Penny I call everyone sweetie.
__Sheldon Penny.  Amy.  Bernadette.
__Leonard You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
__Raj What's that one?
__Sheldon My point.
__Leonard What's the idea?
__Bernadette Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
__Leonard For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
__Leonard That's my French toast.
__Sheldon The Dark Knight has your back. He's scared, but he has your back.
__Leonard Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
__Sheldon I don't need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.
__Howard Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you'd like to examine it?
__Amy Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
__Leonard I don't know what to tell you. Buy her something.
__Sheldon How does that work?
__Bernadette Well, you're not getting cake right now, capisce?
__Penny Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.
__Assistant My apologies. How can I help you today?
__Howard Really? That's great. What?
__Leonard No, I mean just you and me.
__Bernadette Mm, uh… How's it going in there, Penny?
__Amy How do you know? Are you a doctor?
__Sheldon Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?
__Leonard Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date? See how that goes.
__Leonard Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.
__Sheldon Where?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.
__Bernadette Howard.
__Penny No, that's okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don't work out.
__Leonard Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
__Leonard Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity.
__Leonard Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
__Bernadette Oh, smells amazing in here.
__Raj Can I pour you some wine? I think you'll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn't sure, but I didn't want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe's. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.
__Leonard Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
__Raj Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
__Howard Absolutely. But when Ma's hips give out, you're up, kid.
__Sheldon ‘Sup?
__Raj Ooh, Sock Mouth's got him on the ropes.
__Leonard No, thanks. I'm good.
__Leonard Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
__Leonard You say thank you.
__Leonard It's not crazy.
__Leonard Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
__Raj Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.
__Bernadette My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he's putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.
__Leonard Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
__Leonard What are you gonna do?
__ Later.
__Amy Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.
__Amy Okay, smart guy. I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.
__Penny Hey, what are you guys doing here?
__Bernadette In May you're gonna be on the International Space Station.
__Sheldon What are you doing here, Kripke?
__Kripke Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.
__Sheldon Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
__Penny Mm.
__Amy Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
__Leonard Why would you do that?
__Leonard There's no such thing as haircut records.
__Sheldon I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.
__Penny You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair. I could do it for you.
__Howard I got a look at the centrifuge they're going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
__Nurse Can I help you?
__Bernadette Survival training? Is that like camping?
__Leonard Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
__Howard Oh, I love you so much.
__Sheldon What's going on?
__Stuart I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.
__Sheldon Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.
__Raj What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
__Sheldon Oh, good. Hah-hah!
__Amy The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn't answer the question how'd you two meet?
__Amy Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.
__Amy No, he loves that.
__Penny Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
__Howard I'll miss you.
__Leonard Wow. No, it's great. Also, uh, mint in box.
__Penny Why, they're just toys?
__Together No!
__Penny Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.
__Lakshmi I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.
__Lakshmi Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?
__Spock If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
__Raj Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they'd blow us off, and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay. It's like that. Except this time it's true.
__Raj So, while I'm waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I'm supposed to just be alone.
__Sheldon Oh!
__Sheldon Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I've made, he'll reach out to me.
__Howard That's nice.
__Howard Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I'll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you're seeing there is splash back.
__Sheldon This is not my laundry.
__Sheldon What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?
__Sheldon Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.
__Sheldon All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I'm available at his earliest convenience.
__Sheldon Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.
__Hawking You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.
__Raj I've been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.
__Penny Why should I worry?
__Stuart Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.
__Amy No, it's not. I'll explain it to you later.
__Leonard Come on, please.
__Roeger That's great, uh, but that's not why I called. We've run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission's been scrubbed.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Yeah, so?
__Leonard When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Penny It's not funny.
__Bernadette We'll call them. Although my dad's gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
__Howard Yeah, I'm a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.
__Amy Well, it was going to be mine.
__Raj Well, I know how to make it special.
__Leonard No.
__Bernadette Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.
__Leonard Hey.
__Raj Sweet!
__Howard You can't catch a computer virus.
__Mrs Wolowitz Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.
__Amy You do?
__Raj Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.
__Raj All right. Great.
__Howard To infinity and beyond, baby.
__Bernadette I had no idea you were unhappy.
__Dimitri Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?
__Leonard I wish there were more.
__Leonard Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
__Sheldon Are you sleeping?
__Bernadette What's wrong?
__Howard The other astronauts are being mean to me.
__Stuart No, please don't ruin this for me.
__Penny Okay. Here goes.
__Sheldon No, that's my potty training journal.
__Sheldon Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There's a good deal more to come. I didn't really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.
__Leonard She seems nice.
__Leonard All I said was she seems nice.
__Raj Yeah, well, I love her.
__Howard Okay, okay. What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.
__Alex Last name?
__Amy Hmm, that's weird.
__Sheldon If I've learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it's that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.
__Leonard High-energy lasers.
__Leonard No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
__Leonard Isn't that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
__Sheldon I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
__Penny Well, a lot of people can't. Uh, hey.
__Leonard Where are we going?
__Man in Suit Mr. Mandel, I'm your driver.
__Penny All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.
__Penny I don't think so.
__Howard Dr. Schneider?
__Leonard Remember, show your work.
__Amy On the count of three. One, two…
__Howard Hey, guys, guess who's back from space.
__Howard Yes, please.  And I think it's gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me 'round again to find I'm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I'm a rocket man.  Perfect.
__Howard That's not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
__Stuart Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?
__Amy And my boyfriend?
__Penny I guess I could probably try a little harder.
__Amy So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.
__Penny No, I know. It's long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
__Leonard No, no. It's kind of crazy. I've never fooled around in the lab before.
__Howard Clever.
__Raj What's wrong with you?
__Raj Oh, Howard, I've got a party to plan. Don't make me pull it out of you.
__Sheldon Look at that, the problem solved itself.
__Stuart Hey, hey, look at you guys!
__Howard You're just saying that.
__Sheldon Good Lord, what have I done?
__Leonard No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.
__Amy I know. It's finally working.
__Sheldon So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
__Amy Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That's it. End of story. Good night.
__Howard Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
__Howard Can't we talk about this?
__Sheldon I'll tell you. I'm from Texas. Need I say more?
__Wil Are you okay?
__Amy Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.
__Howard I'm looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.
__Raj It was tapenade and you guys suck.
__Raj I can't do anything right for you, can I?
__Leonard I'm talking about important things like emotional maturity.
__Howard Yes, I'm sure. Now, you stand guard, I'm going to…
__Howard It's paprika.
__Cole Hey.
__Raj They are, too.
__Sheldon If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that's been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.
__Howard Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it's parked right out front, space 294.
__Sheldon Very well. You leave me no choice.
__Sheldon Go ahead. That's the only doctorate you'll ever get. It smells funny in here.
__Amy Sure.
__Bernadette Gosh, Amy. I'm sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work, your sex life is also theoretical?
__Penny You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!
__Sheldon Oh. You said I'm not using my space, so I'm using it.
__Sheldon No. That's it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
__Sheldon You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
__Sheldon Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.
__Shopkeeper Uh-huh.
__Mr. Rostenkowski It's fine.
__Howard So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?
__Sheldon How can you sleep? I'm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.
__Raj You can do it.
__Penny That's great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.
__Howard Sir, I'm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don't think this trip is the way to do it. And I can't return these things if there's chunks of duck all over them.
__Mr. Rostenkowski I wouldn't go that far.
__Leonard Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?
__Penny Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?
__Penny Nines or tens?
__Sheldon I open the chest.
__Raj Why can't I find someone? I'm smart, I've got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can't.
__Raj Not that I can think of.
__Sheldon What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
__Raj I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.
__Stuart My carpal tunnel's acting up.
__Leonard What recordings?
__Leonard Sheldon's assistant asked me on a date last night.
__Penny That's great.
__Leonard I'm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
__Leonard Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
__Penny Good.
__Leonard Message received. Ah, excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That's weird. I'm getting called in to Human Resources.
__Howard I'm sorry, I'm a feminist, I don't notice things like how many breasts a robot has.
__Alex Okay.
__Leonard Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
__Stuart What brings you guys here?
__Howard Oh, my God. Leonard, someone's stealing your car!
__Penny Okay.
__Waitress Why don't you ask Scotty to beam you up?
__Howard Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.
__Bernadette You don't know his life.
__Leonard You get that these are personalised action figures.
__Leonard Yep.
__Kripke How do I know you're not going to do that with mine?
__Sheldon Because I'm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.
__Howard I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
__Sheldon I'm fine.
__Penny Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
__Sheldon Well, first of all, I'm quite fond of Amy.
__Leonard Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
__Sheldon Can we get back to work?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It's part of a bonus she got.
__Penny Well, you know what they say, if it ain't broke.
__Raj Well, I, I really couldn't. But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years. Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
__Amy Think about it, Sheldon. I'm not a stranger, we're intellectually compatible, I'm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?
__Leonard Is that so?
__Howard Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.
__Penny No, I don't want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.
__Sheldon You think this is fast? It's just a matter of time before I see Amy's leg stubble in my shower.
__Howard You're still at my mother's?
__Howard It's too late. We'll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
__Amy Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.
__Penny Oh, don't get all huffy. You're the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.
__Leonard You could be a little more into it.
__ Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.
__Leonard You can't find a card that says that?
__Howard Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.
__Howard Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?
__Sheldon Next.
__Raj You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.
__Bernadette They do look happy.
__Howard So where'd you hide it?
__Sheldon Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.
__Penny Well, I am.
__Raj What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
__Raj I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
__Bernadette We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We're all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
__Sheldon Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night  Penny. And I just wanted to tell you  Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you,  Penny.
__Sheldon Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?
__Raj Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It's okay. I can take anything. Unless it's something I did, or said, or am. ‘Cause those are, like, my buttons.
__Girl Oh, you don't want to do that. I'm kind of broken.
__Sheldon I'm not saying people can't use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
__Raj Mm, Disneyland? I don't know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.
__Man In a library?
__Howard No, but I did go to the International Space Station.
__ Later.
__ Hey, guys, come on in.
__Leonard Sheldon, it's, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.
__Howard I couldn't be less interested. Now, come on, I'll take you home.
__Bernadette Feel better?
__Sheldon Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?
__Raj Well, put your mind at ease. I'm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard's dinner party's ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I'm thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
__Sheldon Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.
__Penny Yeah, and the hors d'oeuvres are delightful.
__Amy You didn't know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.
__Raj Yeah,
__Leonard Excuse me, but I think I'm just as qualified as you are.
__Raj You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.
__Janine Hey.
__Leonard Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I'm feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you're on that-that tenure committee?
__Janine Roots?
__Janine Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?
__Leonard Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I'm fine, though.
__Raj Do you think I'm feminine?
__Howard Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she's writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.
__Howard So take what's in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
__Leonard You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let's just see what else is on.
__Amy I'm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn't so overwhelming.
__Lucy Well, you're acting all weird, and I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about.
__Lucy Why were you acting so strange tonight?
__Raj Yeah.
__Sheldon Very mature. You're lucky I'm out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you'll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
__Penny Who's Professor Proton?
__Penny Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
__Penny Relax, Sheldon, he's only a few minutes late.
__Arthur No. A friend would've, would've told me about the elevator.
__Arthur You're the genius.
__Arthur You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children's science show?
__Arthur No, she, she's the only reason I've, I've stayed this long.
__Penny Arthur, are you okay?
__Arthur Well, at, at this point, I'm just glad someone's carrying me down the stairs.
__Raj Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.
__Sheldon Oh, you're not. You look awful.
__Lucy Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.
__Raj I, uh, I'm sorry to put you through that.
__Penny No, it's not.
__Lucy Well, how can I tell you I'm upset if I can't tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead's my best feature? It's scary.
__Amy Sheldon, they're talking about sex.
__Together Ooh!
__Bernadette Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.
__Amy You don't have to come in here and cheer me up.
__Raj It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
__Leonard I have a job.
__Raj Hey, don't discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.
__Amy Ignore him. He's a little nervous 'cause he doesn't think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
__Penny It wasn't me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
__Leonard Calm down. I'm getting out. I have something I want to give you.
__Penny Oh, Raj.
__Leonard What is it?
__Sheldon You're welcome. Good night.
__Howard Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn't be hard for you to meet someone new.
__Sheldon By the way, how are you with zippers?
__Raj You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.
__Sheldon Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I'm okay with it, but I'm really not.
__Bernadette Oh, good, 'cause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I'd have to teach him a thing or two.
__Howard So nothing.
__Sheldon Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.
__Sheldon Penny, it's your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.
__Sheldon Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.
__Howard You're full of oestrogen and you don't act like that.
__Leonard I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
__Sheldon Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I'm wearing this year. Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.
__Howard Fine.
__Leonard No, I don't.
__Sheldon I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I'm going to get in the mail now?
__Sheldon Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.
__Amy Lucky guess.
__Leonard Come on, I said I was sorry.
__Leonard Where do you think I would take you?
__Penny He's still mad at Leonard, huh?
__Amy Well, he's mad at you, too. He says you're the succubus who led his friend astray.
__Penny I don't know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can't be good.
__ Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?
__Sheldon I don't think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.
__Sheldon No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It's based on the premise that Princeton isn't a very good school.
__Leonard No, because I didn't want her on my team.
__Amy Such as?
__Howard Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.
__Leonard What does she think I am?
__Sheldon Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody's.
__Leonard Yeah, Penny might be onto something.
__Bernadette Let's go.
__Bernadette Maybe the spot's the clue.
__Amy It was good.
__Amy All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren't in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.
__Stuart You got it.
__Sheldon Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He's got too much pride, she's got too much prejudice, it just works.
__Leonard So you're looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
__Penny ‘Cause if you're still upset about that, we don't have to go.
__Sheldon Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I'd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.
__Stuart If it is, I'll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I'd started this years ago, I'd be divorced two or three times by now.
__Leonard Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.
__Amy It's actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon's looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
__Bernadette What exactly do you think you'd get sick of?
__Raj That's 'cause you always fill up on chips.
__Leonard Sheldon, I've known you a long time, and I'm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy's right. You're wrong.
__Howard Thanks for getting me in trouble.
__Amy What do you want?
__Penny Ah.
__Penny Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?
__Leonard Well, I took you there. All you did was…
__Leonard That's beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
__Raj Well, I've always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.
__Penny I get that, but why is this so hard?
__Amy What's next?
__Sheldon That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
__Sheldon Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.
__Bernadette Oh, Howie.
__Sheldon This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.
__Amy Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
__Sheldon No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I've heard it my whole life. The word's annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I'm annoying.
__Sheldon Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.
__Bill He said I'd be speaking to a class.
__Arthur He probably stole his wallet, too.
__Bernadette He's kidding. If that were true, it'd be so much bigger.
__Howard Whoa, where is that coming from?
__Raj Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt.
__Sheldon Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired.
__Leonard Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.
__Leonard I'm sorry. I'll, I'll take care of it.
__Sheldon How about this? I promise I won't pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That's a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.
__Leonard Really?
__Bernadette I think that reason's called racism.
__Sheldon Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can't walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.
__Howard You know, you could reimburse the video store owner's next of kin.
__Raj I love you, Penny.
__Sheldon I know. And it wasn't easy. Do you have any idea what it's like to wait for years and never know if you're going to finally get satisfaction?
__Girl What?
__Amy We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
__Sheldon My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
__Bernadette What are they doing?
__Zack I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.
__Raj Well, I couldn't have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.
__Howard Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?
__Bernadette No.
__Howard Then you left me no choice.
__Wil I'm just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher's shadow. But now, it's just one small part of a pretty great life, and it's a part that I'm happy is there.
__Howard No, we were waiting for you.
__Penny Actually, I get what he's saying.
__Sheldon Thank you. Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize for my behaviour last week.
__Sheldon You're telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…
__Amy A little early for alcohol, isn't it?
__Sheldon No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.
__Amy How come you never said she was pregnant?
__Leonard Well, congrats, and it's nice you're gonna be there for your sister.
__Amy It's true. None of you would know me. You wouldn't know Bernadette. You wouldn't be dating Penny.
__Penny I think you're too late.
__Amy Which couldn't have happened if you didn't live across the hall from her, which couldn't have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn't with Penny, she never would have set you up.
__Howard Doesn't matter. Bernadette still would've been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would've been working this beefcake factory. You would've been all over me.
__Leonard We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.
__Bernadette How is this any different?
__Raj Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.
__Amy I am in the mix. And I'm the hottest one.
__Amy That's fine, she's dead.
__Raj You mean like fatties and uggos?
__Second voice No, and that's why he had Erin Pace rewire it…
__Leonard I know, but you're going to be a TV star and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts.
__Mark Harmon on TV We're good.
__Sheldon Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?
__Sheldon All of them.
__Leonard Yeah, I'll call you back.
__Penny No, it's not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I'm still doing it. I can't quit, because guess what? I can't do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I'm such a mess.
__Sheldon Does that mean the relationship is over?
__Sheldon No. That wouldn't be funny at all.
__Leonard I'm gonna go talk to Penny.
__Sheldon No. I was just tricking you.
__Sheldon Leonard, wait. Take me with you.
__Sheldon But.
__Howard Anybody home?
__Sheldon I'm on vacation. What do you think?
__Bernadette Oh, thanks, but I don'twant you to close up. I mean, won't you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.
__Raj Well, do you support this?
__Penny Actually, I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.
__Sheldon What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where's my lemonade?
__Raj Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.
__Leonard Well, now you're making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.
__Bernadette Should we leave?
__Howard Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
__Raj Are you impressed by that?
__Raj Yeah, me, too.
__Amy I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you've never even been with a man.
__Sheldon I submitted you a notarised list.
__Amy Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
__Sheldon Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?
__Leonard Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?
__Leonard Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
__Vet You're the owner?
__Penny Yeah, we weren't even out of the room that long.
__Howard Sorry.
__Bernadette Let's go.
__Amy Leave.
__Amy Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.
__Leonard Oh, I'm sorry.
__Penny No, no, no, stay there. I'm fine on the floor.
__Sheldon Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
__Leonard If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.
__Howard Thank you.
__Penny All right, sweetie, you're paying for this table, and it's your apartment, too.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
__Sheldon It doesn't?
__Amy Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He's manipulating you like he always does.
__Amy Which is stronger than ever.
__Bernadette No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.
__Raj Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
__Amy I think we're gonna go.
__Howard Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn't hear the rest 'cause she took her bra off.
__Penny Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
__Penny How? Unlike me, you have a job. I'm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.
__Raj I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.
__Raj Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
__Bernadette Hi.
__Emily You know, I think I'm just gonna go by myself.
__Howard Thank you, Sheldon.
__Bernadette I didn't know his last name was Bloom.
__ Credits sequence.
__Raj Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn't have any friends.
__Sheldon Yes, but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there's no going back. Boy, I can't wait to see the look on her face. We're leaving right now.
__Sheldon I saw you having naked sex.
__Sheldon Can you recommend a surface you haven't had coitus on?
__Mrs Cooper Go to your room.
__Sheldon But I'm a professional scientist.
__Sheldon I'm a grown man.
__Penny I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it's mine if I want it.
__Amy You're kidding.
__Penny She's thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
__Raj Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it's a clear night, I'm gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.
__Penny Come on, really?
__Bernadette Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She's alive, but she's still in critical condition.
__Barry Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I'm gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.
__Penny No.
__Sheldon Your relationship with Leonard?
__Howard I promise I'll be on my best behaviour.
__Amy I hope he's this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
__Sheldon Well, you know, I've always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.
__Answerphone Next message.
__Sheldon That's helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…
__Penny Hey, that's good. Why'd you guys stop doing that?
__Leonard I also love you.
__Penny Shut up.
__Sheldon Penny, there's only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life's problems, and that's an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you're in a pinch.
__Penny Oh, try again.
__Amy Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.
__Leonard Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
__Penny No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?
__Raj Wow.
__Bernadette How did that get you into science?
__Arthur I'm, I'm sorry about that.
__Leonard Hey, buddy. Heard you're having a rough day. You all right?
__Raj All right. Now what?
__Raj Uh-huh.
__Wil You can't give up. I love you.
__Bernadette So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.
__Penny I am.
__Howard She's doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.
__ General cheering and congratulations.
__Howard I don't know what else we can do.
__Mrs Hofstadter Sure.
__Sheldon I see. You're putting your future bride's happiness above mine.
__Sheldon So, tomorrow?
__Sheldon Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it's simply too much. I need to get away and think.
__Sheldon Of course you are.
__Raj So are you worried because he's replacing you as a son or are you worried because he's becoming her lover?
__Dan I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she's so nice with that squeaky little voice.
__Bernadette I never thought I'd say this, but Penny got a job today.
__Bernadette Okay, calm down. You're not his father, he's not your father. Nobody's anybody's father.
__Sheldon Swish.
__Mrs Davis That is correct.
__Amy Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she's worried that you won't 'cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It's like an earful of melted caramel.
__Bernadette Hey.
__Amy Because it's taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I'm in the centre now, and I love that even more.
__Howard If you're gonna be a crappy teacher, then I'm gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. 'cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now…
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny What?
__Howard Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you're happy.
__Howard Because we were awkward and weird and couldn't play sports!
__Leonard Baseball.
__Howard Thank you, that would be great.
__Bernadette I'm looking at it.
__Leonard Sometimes.
__Bernadette He's so nice.
__Amy It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
__Leonard This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.
__Sheldon I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
__Emily Hi.
__Emily Sure.
__Emily So, it was a hook-up.
__Sheldon And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn't a library, buy it or get out.
__Penny Why are you asking me?
__Bernadette Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.
__Stuart I don't know who he's talking to. She's at Target, buying me shirts.
__Howard It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
__Raj Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
__Sheldon Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?
__Howard Also mine.
__Leonard Well, it's, it's possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.
__Amy Great.
__Bernadette Well, what do you want to do?
__Penny It's my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
__Leonard Guys.
__Sheldon Oh, I'll check Amazon.
__Amy Why'd you tell her? It was working.
__Penny That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
__Amy Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let's just, we'll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I'm gonna quiz you. I'm gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they're gonna be at the strip club.
__Sheldon Ow. That was your fault.
__Raj We're going to be fine.
__Bernadette Was it more or less than falconry school?
__Leonard She made him a chore chart.
__Sheldon Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
__Bernadette Why are you being a baby?
__Sheldon My struggle is emotional.
__Raj Oh. Is it Amy?
__Raj Sheldon, you know what I think of when I'm scared? Voyager.
__Sheldon Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
__Penny Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.
__Penny Why would you say that?
__Man Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two…
__Amy Well, I'm really sorry, but I think it's for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.
__Leonard That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
__Man Anytime. Uh, I've got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.
__Dr Lorvis Original.
__Raj How did you get it?
__Sheldon Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you're too late. All the squares have been purchased.
__Sheldon I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.
__Penny Okay, you can't just go chasing after every girl who's nice to you.
__Leonard Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
__Sheldon All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
__Leonard Just relax, it's a joke. You don't have hormones.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Penny Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot? That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.
__Jeannie Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?
__Leonard Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
__Sheldon Very well. I'm done talking about it.
__Sheldon Well, then why don't you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?
__Raj How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
__Sheldon Come on.
__Sheldon Amy. What's going on?
__Amy And I'm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
__Raj Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.
__Raj Poor Roger Abbott.
__LeVar While?
__Leonard Uh, I've been looking for a Professor Sharpe?
__Howard Seriously?
__Dan No, no. It's okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she's back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.
__LeVar Ugh. What are you doing here?
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard We should get going to Amy's.
__Leonard Okay, how do we catch it?
__Howard Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it'll come to it.
__Bernadette Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers 'cause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why'd you turn it off?
__Leonard I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.
__Amy Okay, let's get this Victorian party started. I've done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.
__Raj All I'm gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it's bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who's smarter? If it's Leonard or me or, you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.
__Photographer Smile.
__Howard We can't do that.
__Amy Look at you on Santa's lap. That's so sweet.
__Leonard Well, I'd like to be green, but you know you always take it.
__Penny Sweetie, you really thought I'd want to do this?
__Sheldon Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, I'm a problem-solver, it's what I do.
__Howard So, in addition to being crazy, you're resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.
__Sheldon Oh. Well, that's all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.
__Leonard What? Then. then why don't you do it?
__Howard You believe in your religion, I'll believe in mine.
__Leonard All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
__Sheldon I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
__Man Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?
__Sheldon No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what's comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.
__Penny You're right, we can't.
__Howard Well, um, we were just kidding around.
__Sheldon I don't want to talk about it.
__Bernadette Well, now we have two reasons.
__Doctor Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?
__Bernadette And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to  tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.
__Bernadette Not now!
__Leonard Yeah, okay, I'm good.
__Howard I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to… is that my mother's furniture?
__Howard Why don't you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
__Sheldon Are you sure?
__Sheldon I don't understand why you're mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.
__Bernadette This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
__Raj And you're eating alone at a deli. I don't buy it, you're not him.
__Nathan Fillion I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.
__Bernadette Oh, my God, Howie.
__Stuart Still can't believe she's gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn't for her, I, I would have been homeless.
__Sheldon You didn't even let me finish.
__Sheldon So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I'm the monster.
__Raj Well, that's what the bullies at Bruce Lee's high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.
__Amy Oh, then I choose a janitor, 'cause I'm about to throw up.
__Sheldon Ah, that's just as well. As much as I'd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I'd most like to have dinner with is myself.
__Raj Oh, so kind of like what's happening with Penny right now.
__Clerk Yes?
__Penny I meant more like a little brother.
__Sheldon No, it wasn't. Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me and I'm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.
__Penny I just want to make sure you get there safe.
__All SURPRISE!
__Bernadette What's happening?
__Penny Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.
__Sheldon So you're saying you wouldn't leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
__Amy I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
__Amy No. Forget it.
__Raj With what?
__Sheldon But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
__Howard We should hang up.
__Leonard So, where do we want to hang it?
__Sheldon I am. Yeah, if I'm going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don't we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
__Sheldon For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.
__Bernadette No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.
__Raj You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?
__Howard Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
__Howard Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.
__Sheldon Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.
__Howard Yeah, what?
__Raj What, and that's not offensive? Where's the line?
__Howard Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.
__Leonard I know.
__Sheldon It was. And even though we're not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn't returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.
__Penny Yeah, so, how many people listen?
__Josh I'm studying oceanography down in San Diego.
__Penny Thanks a lot.
__Howard It was actually just a mechanical hand.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm good.
__Howard Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.
__Raj Okay, that sounds good.
__Raj Okay.
__Raj Well, maybe there's a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.
__Raj Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.
__Penny I, uh, huh.
__Penny Oh. You could tell it to me.
__Sheldon Initiating rotation sequence. Don't look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?
__Leonard Hey, where'd you go?
__Sheldon Not very.
__Sheldon You can't return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
__Penny Oh. Hello. I, I didn't know he was gonna point it at me, so, don't do drugs and stay in school.
__Tech Support Guy Tech Support, can I help you?
__Leonard No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.
__Penny You know, your mom's never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.
__Sheldon Maybe they'll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?
__Mrs Cooper Well, I love you, too. My little bowl of lion chow.
__Mrs Cooper Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?
__Sheldon Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
__Mrs Cooper It doesn't matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.
__Penny Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.
__Stuart Yeah.
__Dr Hofstadter Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny That's probably it. What'd you say to her?
__Sheldon Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.
__Penny Okay, see, that's even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.
__Penny Still haven't heard from her?
__Penny No. Sheldon, we're getting married.
__Penny Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We're committed to each other. We're happy. A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.
__Sheldon After all these years. I'm really happy for the two of you.
__Raj I think we should talk.
__Leonard Yeah?
__Amy I hope you understand.
__Sheldon Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.
__Penny She did?
__Sheldon Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don't care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.
__Penny Okay, will you relax? You're not missing anything special.
__Sheldon Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn't I invited to this?
__Amy Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
__Sheldon We make everyone feel awkward. That's our thing.
__Leonard Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.
__Howard Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, Shelly.
__Stuart I'm sure you did. Maybe that's the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.
__Sheldon Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.
__Sheldon He does? Who is it?
__Sheldon Mandy Chao?
__Sheldon Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
__Sheldon Really? I never imagined it any other way.
__Howard And I wish Leonard never told me. He's the bad guy here.
__Amy Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.
__Mandy Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?
__Leonard I've been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why.
__Leonard Huh? If you think that's cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?
__Raj Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.
__Raj This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
__Raj Uh, okay, let's see. They've got spicy food and there's a chance you'll get diarrhoea.
__Leonard Your house?
__Amy Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.
__Penny You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.
__Amy I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it's to look like a Klingon.
__Raj Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.
__Howard I think it's a tyre.
__Penny's Dad Penny' Oh, ten, twelve months ago.
__Bernadette What did we do?
__Penny Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he's illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
__Penny It's not funny. You're up. Call your mother.
__Howard No, it's too broad of a beam. You'd need something more precise, like Superman's heat vision.
__Raj Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
__Stuart What's that?
__Stuart Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.
__Leonard Do I really have to do that now?
__Amy I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.
__Amy I can't believe he ran my credit.
__Bernadette I'm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.
__Emily I think it's very cute.
__Howard Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.
__Raj That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
__Penny Sure.
__Sheldon Ah, touché.
__Barry In fencing, we don't call it a stab. We call it a touch.
__Stuart I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn't run away or kill itself.
__Stuart Okay, we're all feeling it. Yes, I'll go out with you.
__Bernadette Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
__Amy How'd that go?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Do you want liquid helium or not?
__Sheldon I'm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
__Man Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.
__Leonard No, nothing. We just changed our mind.
__Stuart A few people?
__Amy It's going fine. It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
__Bernadette I, I thought you weren't ready to start seeing people.
__Bernadette Okay, listen, I'm thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.
__Adam Do you have any Spock collectibles?
__Adam Did it work?
__Penny Um.
__Penny I'm just saying, you pretend you don't, but you have feelings just like everybody else.
__Leonard He didn't meant that.
__Howard And this an actual I'll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I'll think about it”?
__Leonard Ah, well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.
__Penny Oh. Good for you.
__Amy Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.
__Amy Do you have any heels higher than this? He's pretty tall.
__Sheldon Are you sure? I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.
__Raj And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?
__Raj Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.
__Raj Forty-five.
__Sheldon Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.
__Dave Oh. Okay.
__Dave No, it's, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.
__Penny Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?
__Amy Good. I want you to be happy.
__Howard Sorry. It's just, you're you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.
__Amy You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
__Sheldon It's called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
__Sheldon What is that?
__Amy I miss this.
__Amy Hi, Sheldon. I'm just driving home from my mother's.
__Amy I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.
__Leonard Put on some headphones.
__Penny I'll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
__Raj Okay. I posted it.
__Penny Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don't have mental problems.
__Amy That's Sheldon.
__Amy Get back here.
__Howard Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.
__Sheldon Hello. Sorry I'm late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
__Sheldon I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.
__Wil See? That's what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn't gonna change at all.
__Penny I don't know. He said he's ready.
__Raj It is.
__Caption A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away….
__Sheldon All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
__Amy Okay, I'm glad you're not here?
__Leonard Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.
__ Credits sequence.
__Penny I'm not sick. It's for work. There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I've been trying to get in for months.
__Leonard Uh, she's my mother. You know her?
__Raj It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
__Sheldon That's a great idea. I've got it. We'll call it Cooper.
__Sheldon I haven't settled on anything yet.
__Sheldon It's perfect. It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.
__Amy All of them?
__Sheldon I miss you as well.
__Leonard And it's gone.
__Leonard Let me refresh your memory.
__ Flashback
__Leonard That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.
__Leonard Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I'm not in a position to just say you can come.
__Sheldon That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.
__Bernadette This is so cool.
__Leonard What do we do, kick them off?
__Sheldon Emily, as I'm sure you know, I'm considered an odd fellow. But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.
__Meemaw Moon Pie.
__Meemaw I'm so happy to see you, too.
__Raj Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.
__Sheldon Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Sheldon Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day, I haven't forgotten about you tonight.
__Howard How?
__Sheldon Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.
__Bernadette It is Valentine's Day. How about Valentino?
__Howard Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you're a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
__Leonard Well, glad you're feeling better.
__Amy Well, I, I wouldn't say right away.
__Sheldon And actually, it was three different men.
__Raj Rich parents, don't forget, rich parents.
__Barry Hey, I think I got cut off.
__Amy Interesting, and when would you use the singular?
__Amy I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
__Penny Uh, I don't know, a bar?
__Amy Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
__Bernadette Doctor said I can't have sushi.
__Penny Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.
__Amy Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
__Penny Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?
__Howard I'm not finding anything either.
__Raj Just bust a move,
__Leonard Me, too. So, you ever think about it?
__Raj You mean, some guy in a lame suit?
__Stuart You, you're pregnant?
__Howard Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?
__Amy Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.
__Amy Well, I'm, I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.
__Sheldon Oh. Thank you.
__Penny You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn't invite her.
__Raj Come on, Sheldon, say something.
__Leslie Has it?
__Leonard Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.
__Howard Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
__Howard Oh, I don't think there will be.
__Attorney That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.
__Leonard Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.
__Bernadette Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it's metal.
__Sheldon But which one of us should be the party who…
__Raj No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.
__ fade
__ Hello?
__Howard I appreciate that.
__Penny Like this?
__Sheldon Can we please change the subject?
__Raj Okay. That's cool. I guess everybody's involved in this project but me. So, see ya.
__Amy So where are we going?
__Howard Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
__Leonard He'll never make it in time.
__Raj I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
__Bernadette Yeah, let's see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.
__Penny Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?
__Sheldon Well, oh, it's just a, it's a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the hockey puck dent.
__Sheldon Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.
__Howard Hi.
__Howard Yeah. Anywhere you want.
__Penny What am I smelling?
__Howard The three of us aren't having this baby. Just the two of us.
__Amy No, it's only if you've done it.
__Howard What? Are you gonna cry?
__Howard I'll go get him.
__Penny Because I don't feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven't been happy for a while.
__Penny Doesn't matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.
__Leonard This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
__Sheldon You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
__Howard Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
__Leonard You love The Simpsons.
__Amy Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.
__Sheldon She did.
__Amy Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
__Penny Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
__Sheldon I'll be back.
__Leonard How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?
__Penny The little choo-choo for toddlers?
__Sheldon Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I've been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.
__Howard I bet you'd like a drink right now.
__Sheldon You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
__Raj Hey, Claire.
__Sheldon Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.
__Howard Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.
__Howard I know. What are they gonna talk about?
__Sheldon Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.
__Amy Mike deGrasse Tyson?
__Sheldon Well, other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.
__Bernadette This is getting fun. What's next?
__Raj Don't listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.
__Penny We didn't.
__Penny Or a way for you to avoid her?
__Sheldon Oh, bad news. Amy's making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.
__Beverly Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?
__Sheldon Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
__Beverly Since the airport, dear.
__Sheldon It went well. Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.
__Howard Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.
__Man Hey, guys.
__Woman You made it.
__Sheldon No, it's not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.
__Leonard Oh, please don't.
__Beverly Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?
__Beverly I'm still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son's wedding is difficult to ignore.
__Penny It was spur of the moment.
__Sheldon Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.
__Raj Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.
__Bernadette Oh, stop. You know what's really happening? All the movies you've watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they've completely twisted your thinking. No one's after you, no one's listening to you, no one cares about you.
__Mary I work at the church.
__Alfred Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.
__Mary I'm a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.
__Alfred Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?
__Leonard Well, why? What's wrong?
__Beverley Stop it, Sheldon.
__Howard Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.
__Raj Howard Wolowitz?
__Raj Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
__Howard Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
__Alfred How is everyone today?
__Beverley Good, and you?
__Susan Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister's wedding.
__Wyatt Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don't lend your new brother-in-law money.
__Sheldon Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.
__Alfred I'd like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don't bring out the best in each other.
__Leonard Thank you.
__Amy Sheldon, you're mother's an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.
__Mary You'll get there. You've just gotta put some zing on it.
__Raj He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
__Raj Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.
__Bernadette Hey. What brings you by?
__Leonard Hi.
__Colonel Williams Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.
__Howard Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.
__Amy Well, to be honest, it's not like a party party, it's more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what's going on in other fields. I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.
__Raj Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.
__Bernadette Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
__Leonard According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's two.
__Raj Well, not now.
__Bernadette Well, you're not, so just drop it.  I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?
__Sheldon Yeah, but I do.
__Bernadette Raj, why don't I care about anything?
__Bert Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You're nice people.
__Dr Koothrapalli Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.
__Sheldon He said start with it, not end with it.
__Sheldon The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
__Penny Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.
__Bernadette Wait.
__Penny Oh.
__Amy Can't make fun of something that's a null set.
__Raj I don't know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.
__Sheldon Yes.
__Sheldon When we're sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto
__Howard Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn't the only magic these hands can do. In fact, what's this between your toes?
__Howard It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someone's in the house.
__Howard Is that the hot tub?
__Bernadette Who is it?
__Bernadette I meant like, what are you doing here?
__Bernadette I told you raccoons don't say uh-oh.
__Penny Is it? Oh. It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.
__Leonard Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby.
__Penny Thank you.
__Howard Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.
__Leonard Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas… ‘s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.
__Amy You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
__Amy You never went into that haunted house.
__Howard But it's the safest crib you can buy. And if you don't like it, we can return it.
__Penny Okay. Who do I make it out to?
__Sheldon She's learning English from TV.
__Bernadette I was hoping it'd be quieter.
__Raj I've been babysitting him way longer than you have.
__Sheldon Who haven't learned their place yet.
__Raj We don't get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
__Leonard Are you kidding me?
__Leonard Yeah? What are you keeping?
__Penny We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
__Sheldon Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.
__Isabella Bueno, um, I'm just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I'll get out of your way.
__ expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.
__Raj What? What are you talking about?
__Penny You only watch what you eat when you're afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
__Penny All right.
__Leonard Oh, so she's an astronomer?
__Isabella Oh, really? You made Cuban food?
__Amy I don't think so.
__Isabella Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah's favourite things.
__Raj Uh.
__Raj Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain.
__Isabella If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?
__Raj Excuse me, but I'm Indian.
__Raj Hey, congratulations Bert.
__Sheldon Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.
__Sheldon Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice.
__Howard His eyes also light up in the dark.
__Bernadette Fine, then do it.
__Amy You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. You've got love, you're in good health, you've got a roof over your head.
__Leonard If it helps, I'm questioning your life choices, too.
__Sheldon I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.
__Penny I seem to be losing.
__Leonard Yes, you do.
__Raj It's just that they've had plenty of help.
__Theodore It's like the '40s again.
__Sheldon Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I'm running?
__Sheldon I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.
__Sheldon Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.
__Leonard Well, I'd like that, too.
__Stuart Meet you outside in 2 minutes.
__Howard I love you.
__Amy Well, first deliveries can be slow.
__Amy I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
__Stuart Sorry. I thought these were room ice chips. I'll go get some more.
__Bernadette No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off.
__Stuart Uh, yeah, I got something. Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner. Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?
__Howard She's here, the baby's here.
__Sheldon All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I'm going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon's not.
__Leonard Absolutely not.
__ Flashback.
__ Flashback.
__ You do make a cute elf.
__Raj Oh, don't take it so personally, maybe your baby's just a jerk.
__Bernadette Don't make me laugh.
__Howard Do you need help getting out?
__Penny Well, it's not just the pants, it's just, it's like since we got married he doesn't really try any more.
__Raj Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didn't think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.
__Howard Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
__Raj Hang on. No offence to her father, but he's not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do.
__Amy If you miss me x plus one, I'll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the second…
__Sheldon And it's just the way you like it.
__Howard Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
__Raj It's nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughter's going to as well.
__Raj Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
__Penny Do you really think that's funny?
