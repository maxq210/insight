__Receptionist Can I help you?
__Receptionist Oh, take your time. I'll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.
__Leonard New neighbour?
__Sheldon Hi.
__Leonard Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
__Leonard Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard Yes I now, but…
__Sheldon Oh, of course.
__Sheldon Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.
__Sheldon So we get to have a scene with him?
__Leonard Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.
__Leonard Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
__Penny Am I interrupting.
__Leonard They're not going anywhere.  So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work.
__Penny Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.
__Sheldon Challenge accepted.  We're locked out.
__Leonard Why not?
__Sheldon No,  that's ridiculous.
__Penny Son of a Bitch!
__Howard Oh boy, I was afraid of this.
__Leonard And control it how?
__Sheldon Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?
__Leonard Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.
__Leonard No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!
__Leonard No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and…
__Raj Like who?
__Leonard Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I'm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.
__Leonard Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.
__Leonard Us guys?
__Leonard Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.
__Leonard You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.
__Leonard Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?
__Sheldon An actual real scientist.  How was that?
__Leonard You know, I'm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
__Leonard And we all thank you.
__Penny Oh, sure I am.
__Sheldon I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.
__Leonard So… fish.
__Sheldon I know, but why?
__Leonard A death ray?
__Sheldon No.
__Leonard Really?
__Lesley What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?
__Leonard Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?
__Sheldon Oh, that is so… so…
__Lesley Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.
__Lesley Thank you!
__Sheldon Anime?
__Penny Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.
__Howard Bjow
__Raj Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.
__Nurse Costume Girl No thanks.
__Sheldon Alright, but if we're going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage.
__Leonard Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.
__Kurt So what, I'm unevolved?
__Leonard Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so….
__Sheldon Oh, what fresh hell is this?
__Penny Hey guys.
__Leonard Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.
__Sheldon Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.
__Sheldon Hm!
__Leonard Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally… sleep tight.
__Leonard Leonard.
__Howard Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christie stay with me.
__Christie Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!
__Waiter No eliminations.
__Sheldon Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.
__Raj And over here is Sheldon.
__Raj But Papa, I'm not supposed…
__Mrs Koothrappali Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it's Doogie time! Bye bye.
__Howard Let's not forget it's got some really catchy tunes.
__Leonard Look, Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn't drink, so…  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he'd like to take up drinking.
__Sheldon Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.
__Lalita Well, you are.
__Penny Drinks do not work that way.
__Sheldon Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.
__Sheldon That's Princess Punchali.
__Sheldon Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.
__Lalita Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.
__Sheldon I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.
__Raj But you're a dentist, he's nuts.
__Dr Koothrappali Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.
__Mrs Koothrappali Who is it? We can't see.
__Dr Koothrappali Now, Rajesh.
__Leonard Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
__Sheldon Look at me, look at me, I've got goosebumps.
__Sheldon Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.
__Penny Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.
__Leonard Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.
__Leonard Great.
__Penny Which was?
__Leonard You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
__Leonard Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologise for?
__Leonard It's the social protocol, it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at.
__Leonard I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.
__Sheldon Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web.
__Howard I'm game.
__Toby Not double blind studies.
__Leonard Sounds good.
__Penny Boy, it's good to be back.
__Sheldon Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.
__Leonard I mix pancake batter in this!
__Leonard Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.
__ Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard?  Ow!
__Leonard No kidding?
__Leonard Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
__Sheldon What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.
__Howard It's Leonard.
__Howard For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.
__Penny Can you please come get him?
__Penny Okay, well, you feel better.
__Sheldon Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”
__Gablehouser I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we're the best physics research facility in the country.
__Dennis I already know you're not. You don't have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.
__Leonard Yes sir.
__Howard You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.
__Sheldon So, this is engineering, huh?
__Sheldon Well, up until now I've had better things to do. So, what are we making today?
__Leonard Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I'm not saying no.
__Howard You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.
__Gablehouser Hm?
__Leonard No, we can't.
__Howard Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
__Penny Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.
__Sheldon Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.
__Leonard Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.
__Leslie No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.
__ A sigma particle.
__Third Floor Janitor You didn't answer question.
__Raj Sheldon?
__Sheldon Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.
__Leonard Yes I'm upset.
__Leonard Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?
__Leonard Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
__Sheldon Who cares, as long as you pick me.
__Leonard Maybe she's his lawyer.
__Leonard Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.
__Sheldon I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.
__Sheldon Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.
__Sheldon You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.
__Sheldon I weep for humanity.
__Leonard Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.
__Sheldon Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles.
__Sheldon My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.
__Penny he can scrape it off.
__ Credits sequence.
__Howard Don't ask.
__Howard Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
__Penny Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.
__Howard How's it going?
__Howard Oh-oh.  Oh-oh!
__Sheldon No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.
__Leonard Really, ‘cos you don't look like you're swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.
__Penny Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.
__Howard Pees hep me!
__Raj Hey, look, I found an iPod.
__Leonard I said I'm her friend. Not her gay friend.
__Penny No, at the sub shop we were only making out.
__Leonard Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.
__Penny But I never gave the man a chance to explain.
__Leonard Can we please change the subject.
__Penny But he had already moved on.
__Penny Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.
__Sheldon Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon…
__Penny Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first.
__Penny Right.
__Raj Nice close up, by the way.
__Howard Give him time.
__Penny No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.
__Raj Did you take a band aid off in front of him?
__Sheldon Uh-oh.
__Raj How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
__Howard Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench?
__Howard Well I'm glad that's settled.
__Sheldon That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
__Sheldon I drank milk that tasted funny.
__Sheldon I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
__Sheldon Well, statistically speaking…
__Penny Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.
__Penny Goodnight Sheldon.
__Sheldon Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
__Leonard I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.
__Sheldon You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?
__Sheldon And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
__Sheldon The Conqueror.
__Penny What are you doing?
__Leonard I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.
__Sheldon Do you have the enchanted sword?
__Penny Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
__Penny Okay, well you were great, thanks.  Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.
__Leonard It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.
__Leslie Well, I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.
__Howard Mmmm, testify.
__Sheldon There, problem solved.
__Howard Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.
__Sheldon Apologise, for what?
__Sheldon Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.
__Howard Try less teeth. (Does. It isn't much better.)
__Gablehauser Hello boys.
__Sheldon I can make it, but I won't.
__Penny Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?
__Leonard Anythingforagreencard.com?
__Sheldon Brown rice, not white?
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.
__Leonard That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
__Penny No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
__Dr Koothrappali Look, Rajesh, I understand, you're in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don't want it for a steady diet.
__Penny I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
__Sheldon I didn't. Let's go.
__Penny Sheldon, it's fine.
__Penny Fine.
__Sheldon And the comic book store.
__Penny Doing what?
__DMV Lady Next!
__Ramona Thanks. Where should I put this?
__Leonard No, come on, now, we're going out.
__Penny What are you guys gonna do?
__Sheldon You heard her. How can I argue with me?
__Penny Get rid of her how?
__Leonard We are communicating through the wall.
__Ramona Oh, bite me!
__Howard Sheldon, you've already had four servings.
__Howard A house, where?
__Penny Yeah, I guess.
__Howard Isn't it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Onion rings?
__Sheldon But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
__Sheldon Why would you do that?
__Penny A sports metaphor?
__Penny All right, yeah, I'll play along. What was my first strike?
__Leonard Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
__Leonard Are you insane? You're not going to party with them, you're not even going to get anywhere near that place.
__Sheldon Why?
__Penny No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
__Penny Time to do your laundry, huh?
__Sheldon Mwah-ha-ha.
__Leonard No. Look, this has to stop.
__Sheldon Thank you.
__Sheldon In what sense is that a compromise?
__Sheldon What did I do?
__Leonard Okay.
__Leonard Just said Howard's a terrific guy. He's got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
__Leonard Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
__Leonard Just say, Leonard went to the office.
__ Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.
__Howard Hey, it's me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we're gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.
__Leonard On what?
__All Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!
__Steph Yeah.
__Steph You're kidding!
__Leonard What landing party?
__Leonard Oh, clearly I could have.
__Howard I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
__Sheldon Penny. Zucchini bread.
__Leonard Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
__Leonard Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
__Sheldon Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.
__Leonard What for?
__Penny Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That's bold.
__Sheldon Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
__Sheldon Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.
__Howard She's not my type.
__Sheldon I knew it! What do I do?
__Computer voice Honey.
__Sheldon Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
__Leonard Did not.
__Howard Did, too.
__ Credits sequence.
__Sheldon Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you've given me. It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
__Penny Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
__Leonard I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?
__Sheldon That presupposes Penny is tense.
__Sheldon You put no thought into that.
__Leonard That's funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
__Sheldon Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
__Together One, two, three, go.
__Howard Gentlemen, goggles.
__Howard Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You'd be the only doable girl.
__Penny You're a pig, Howard.
__Penny Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
__Penny I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
__Penny Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard's ear) What?
__Leonard Yes, we did, Kripke.
__Kripke There's no guawantee we've gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let's thwow down. You know, unless you're afwaid.
__Kripke We're all pathetic and cweepy and can't get girls, that's why we fight wobots. If you're not there, you'll be exposed to widicule.
__Penny Get out.
__Penny Okay. Well, bye.  So close
__Leonard Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
__Sheldon You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we're up against and we can modify Monte so that he's prepared.
__Sheldon It is extracted from the plant…
__Raj Feel better now?
__Leonard It's kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
__Howard I can fix it.
__Kripke Hewo to you, too.
__Sheldon D-d-d! That's where I sit.
__Leonard In the bathroom.
__Howard There are too many variables. It would take forever.
__Sheldon Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work.
__Howard See ya.
__Penny Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
__Sheldon I sincerely hope so.
__Sheldon Of course. That's how you move a conversation forward.
__Leonard Why?
__Penny Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
__Leonard Stop it!
__Leonard Where are you going?
__Penny He was drunk.
__Howard You want the Valley of Fire? It's right here.
__ Ooh, double sixes.
__Leonard Bye.
__Leonard's Mother Leonard' Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.
__Howard We'll talk about this later.
__Sheldon What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
__Sheldon No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I'm done.
__Howard Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.
__Leonard Here we go.
__Leonard I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
__Leonard Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
__Sheldon Don' we're taking the train!
__Leonard Is that who I think it is?
__Raj Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
__Raj Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?
__Raj Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
__Sheldon No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.
__ Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.
__Summer No. I didn't.
__Leonard Hey, how'd it go?
__Penny I don't know.
__Penny So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
__Sheldon And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
__Penny I understand.
__Penny No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!
__Sheldon That wasn't a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.
__Leonard Okay, what's wrong with it?
__Penny We do?
__Raj You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
__Sheldon I guess I won't be needing this.
__Howard I won't lie, it's pretty dope.
__Alicia Nice dress.
__Alicia About what?
__Raj Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?
__Howard Here we go.
__ Credits sequence.
__Stuart Let me know if you need anything.
__Stuart Hello again.
__Penny It's really good.
__Leonard Nobody's up in anybody's business, let's just buy our stuff and go.
__Leonard When did you pick up on that?
__Sheldon Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
__Leonard Gee, thanks a lot.
__Leonard That's your system?
__Stuart Oh, great!
__Leonard What about the ones in the corner?
__Stuart Fine. You win.
__Leonard God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.
__Raj Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?
__Leonard You got it.
__Leonard We were up to you.
__Sheldon Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.
__Howard Okay, fine, I'm checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she's saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.
__Raj Hello, Michaela.
__Leonard Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
__Leonard Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
__Raj It's too bad he wasn't here for that hooker. She's exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.
__Leonard Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a… you know…
__Penny Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
__Sheldon How can one person be a whole movie?
__Sheldon Thank you, that's very helpful.
__Sheldon Alright. Goodnight.
__Leonard Yes.
__Penny Your home is twenty feet from here.
__Howard No, I'm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.
__Raj Oh, get over yourself, it's a high-tech toilet.
__Howard Just tell him to do everything you've done with her for the last two years.
__Leonard No, no that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
__Sheldon At times.
__Leonard All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
__Leonard Why?
__Leonard Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.
__Leonard Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
__Howard I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
__Penny Excuse me.
__Penny All right, I'll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Sheldon I hadn't thought of that. I guess we're done here.
__Sheldon Way ahead of you, that's an “I Can't Believe It's Not Butter” stick.
__Leonard All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
__Leonard Dinner's ready!
__Leonard Reconstituted Thai food.
__Sheldon Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
__Howard Yeah, we'll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.
__Raj For me, it was a bonding moment.
__Leonard Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it's… don't ask.
__Leonard Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.
__Penny It's great to see you too. Come on in.
__Penny Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?
__Leonard Because when he wasn't happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
__Sheldon Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
__Penny Well, they're pretty tasty.
__Howard What are you doing?
__Leonard It's a snowflake. From the North Pole.
__Howard Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.
__Leonard Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
__Mrs Cooper For every cup and every…
__Leonard What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
__Leonard You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
__Howard What are you doing here?
__Leonard There's more to life than sex, Raj.
__Leonard To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don't know…
__Penny Okay. See, we should've done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
__Sheldon Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
__Sheldon Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
__Sheldon I'm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
__Prof Crawley Let me ask you one first. What's a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?
__Sheldon No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
__Sheldon Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
__Sheldon Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
__Sheldon Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
__Sheldon Hardly.
__Sheldon Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?
__Leonard Morning.
__Howard Aaaaaargh! Okay, that's it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.
__Penny Of course.
__Leonard Unbelievable.
__Penny What?
__Howard Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother's tur-brka-fil.
__Sheldon Nailed it.
__Leonard Hey.
__Sheldon For me.
__Leonard Little bit, yeah.
__Howard Tonight's the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
__Raj Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.
__Howard Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he's still working with Sheldon, so I thought I'd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It's the perfect meal for apres l'amour.
__Penny See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn't have had to hear that.
__Leonard Thank you. There's lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
__Raj Okay, you got me there, but you're wrong about this!
__Sheldon All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me…
__Sheldon Doing what?  All right, you've made your point.
__Raj So you were wrong.
__Bernadette Are you going to answer it?
__Howard Oh, wow. You didn't, did you?
__Howard It's a date.
__Wil Wheaton Two-headed tiger.
__All three Kites, ho!
__Raj No, she didn't.
__Howard I would've caught up to her if I hadn't pulled a hammy.
__Penny Okay, great. Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
__Leonard There's no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
__Leonard Mimesis?
__Sheldon I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
__Leonard Wait. What are you talking about?
__Raj Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.
__Howard No, I mean, she's obviously way out of line.
__Sheldon This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you'd be familiar with the paradigm.
__Penny I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
__Sheldon Considering the number of transgressions you've committed that he's overlooked, don't you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
__Sheldon Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
__Howard Alright, let's see what's on the east coast feed.
__Penny Uh-huh.
__Sheldon That doesn't mean one won't be in another, especially if I'm driving.
__Penny But don't look.
__Raj I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
__Leonard Quick, get forks.
__Howard You don't need forks. It's so tender, it falls apart in your hands.
__Howard That's still not funny.
__Howard Really? Tall?
__Sheldon Did you laugh?
__Sheldon No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
__Leonard It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
__Sheldon Wait, no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.
__Bernadette I've been meaning to go over there.
__Sheldon Can't you surprise him in some other way? For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.
__Bernadette So, how's your experiment going?
__Howard No.
__Leonard Excuse me?
__Leonard I believe you.
__Howard Huh?
__Howard's Mother Howard' Lamb stew? I'd have to go to the supermarket.
__Howard Thanks, Ma.
__Penny I don't know.
__Howard I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.
__Bernadette No, you didn't. You said Leonard's experiment was stupid.
__Leonard Mmm, in my family, holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
__Sheldon Leonard, I'm no expert on meditation, but if you're trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
__Beverley Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?
__Beverley Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you'll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.
__Raj I don't want to do that.
__Leonard Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you're both scientists. Help me out here.
__Policeman We're done here. Call this number, and we'll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.
__Sheldon Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.
__Penny I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.
__Leonard He's right, Penny. It's all there.
__Sheldon Oh! No, she's right, I don't need to know what you were doing. Carry on.
__Sheldon Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
__Sheldon I am moving on. I'm going to be a Bozite.
__Sheldon You're right.  It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.
__Leonard Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
__Bernadette When Howard tried to do the splits…
__Penny Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Oh, all right.
__Leonard Yeah, well, he's extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?
__Penny Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We're going to have to break up.
__Sheldon No, I wasn't talking to Leonard.
__Sheldon Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.
__Sheldon I could do that.
__Leonard Double guacamole?
__Leonard I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
__Raj Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny.
__Howard I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
__Leonard In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.
__Sheldon Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.
__Sheldon I've made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here's Frodo.
__Penny I'll talk to Leonard.
__Penny I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
__Penny Yes.
__Howard I'm sad to say I taught him those moves.
__Sheldon Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.
__Leonard Good, good, so, who's Stan Lee?
__Sheldon Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.
__Guard Well, it ain't a wishing well.
__Leonard Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
__Penny Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
__Stuart Maybe we can make a deal.
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
__ rule them all.
__Raj Is it Eddie Crispo?
__Raj Why don't we go after your mother?
__Raj You're right. Let's talk about your grandmother.
__Raj Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.
__Raj The fires of Mount Doom?
__Howard My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that's 24-7, buddy.
__Howard Oh, that's not a good name.
__Raj Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.
__Sheldon Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.
__Leonard Damn right, I'm angry with my mother. For God's sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That's when the bed-wetting started again.
__Sheldon If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.
__On-screen Sheldon On- Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here's Uranus.
__Leonard You're welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
__Raj I'm just asking, dude. It happens.
__Howard I'm sure you're probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?
__Penny What?
__Sheldon I've been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she's upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.
__Penny Did Leonard send you over here?
__All The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
__Penny Tell me about it.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I'm thirsty, so I'm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.
__Leonard Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
__Penny Oh, God, I feel terrible.
__Sheldon I got lost.
__Penny We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.
__Penny No, be friends. You and me.
__Leonard Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
__Sheldon Oh, let me just get one thing. It's my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn't pass through here. Now, good night. And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.
__Leonard Uh, six.
__Elizabeth Morning, Sheldon.
__Sheldon Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I'm going to relieve myself.
__Sheldon Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard's bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.
__Leonard Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
__Howard What do you mean what? It's Halo night.
__Raj I'm not hungry.
__Howard Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
__Past Leonard Excuse me, I'm looking for Sheldon Cooper's apartment.
__Leonard In retrospect, that was clue number two.
__Past Sheldon All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?
__Past Sheldon And you'll be willing to drive me?
__Past Sheldon That's correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I'll show you the rest of the apartment.
__Past Leonard Does that really need to be in the agreement?
__Leonard Do I get some sympathy now?
__Past Leonard We can fix that. Let's leave.
__Past Sheldon Not correctly.
__Penny Um…
__Zack Well, mission accomplished.
__Zack One question. How can you be sure it won't blow up?
__Leonard Uh, that's a great question, Zack.
__Penny Sheldon! Play nice.
__Howard Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
__Sheldon FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.
__Howard Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.
__Leslie Yeah, 18 months.
__Raj Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.
__Sheldon You're bluffing.
__Leonard I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
__Sheldon Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.
__Howard Hey, Sheldon?
__Penny How long has this been going on?
__Penny Why not?
__Amy But the light indicates…
__Sheldon All right. It was hell.
__Raj Penis first?
__Howard Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!
__Leonard Well, then let's un-pause it.
__Penny 14.
__Nurse ‘Cause that's all you needed, right?
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
__Leonard Tough break. You want eggs?
__Sheldon A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
__Sheldon Well, if it's not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung's Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
__Penny Hey, what's my share?
__Penny What am I up to now?
__Raj That's two, dude. Write your own jokes.
__Penny You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
__Steve Wozniak Nerds.
__Penny Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
__Amy In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?
__Sheldon Oh, yes. You should've been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.
__Raj Don't ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.
__Penny Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.
__Sheldon Yes. And I'd thank you to do the same.
__Raj I'm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?
__Raj That's very offensive.
__Amy We appear to have reached an impasse.
__Raj You're kidding.
__Leonard Yeah.
__Mrs Cooper My, my, that's a powerful smell.
__Mrs Cooper Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.
__Howard I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
__Howard No, of course not.
__Howard I did a stupid thing.
__Leonard Yeah, I guessed that.
__Howard I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
__Howard Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?
__Howard No. Why would you? I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.
__Howard I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.
__Sheldon Brobdingnagian.
__Raj Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.
__Penny Okay.
__Bernadette What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
__Leonard He's Glissinda the troll.
__Katee Sackhoff Trust me, she's ready. Make the move.
__Katee Sackhoff Listen to me, Howard, it's time. Make the move, now.
__Leonard Because I don't need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
__Leonard Keep going. I'm listening.
__Sheldon He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
__Sheldon Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.
__Sheldon Wait. What?
__Leonard There you go.
__Howard What's with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
__Leonard Who is it?
__Amy Amy Farrah Fowler.
__Raj I'm so not talking to you. I'm talking to him.
__Sheldon He rejected train day.
__Sheldon You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
__Leonard It's getting pretty late, how come you're still up?
__Sheldon Go north. You can't go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You don't have the sword. Good golly, it's as if it's actually happening to me.
__Leonard Alright, and Raj.
__Sheldon I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?
__Raj Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.
__Leonard Did something happen today that's bothering you?
__Sheldon That's not how it looks in the picture.
__Raj I haven't cried like this since Toy Story 3.
__Bernadette Olive.
__Raj Eight for 28.
__Howard Oh, shut up.
__Leonard What's a stadium pal?
__Amy I'm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia's list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.
__Sheldon You know what? I'm going back to I told you so. I told you so.
__Leonard Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?
__Penny What the hell was that?
__Sheldon You whistled?
__Wil He's got the movie! Get him!
__Man Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.
__Leonard No.
__Leonard Penny kissed me.
__Howard Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.
__Penny Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
__Howard How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.
__Raj How do you know that?
__Raj Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?
__Howard What?
__Penny So not funny, dad.
__Wyatt Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.
__Sheldon Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.
__Raj Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.
__Bernadette Right. Help, I'm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
__Penny Why are you making this so difficult?
__Howard What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
__Leonard I'll give it a shot.
__Sheldon Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?
__Penny Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I's with little asses? Cool.
__Sheldon Localized to what region?
__Howard How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
__Sheldon I reject it.
__Sheldon Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.
__Sheldon No, although it's a question I've been pondering since preschool.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Mm-hmm.
__Penny Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
__Leonard Why me?
__Zack Are you mad at me?
__Penny I'm still mad at you.
__Sheldon Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe in wearing costumes. She isn't the free spirit I am.
__Penny All right. Let's get this thing over with.
__Penny What the hell is wrong with you?
__Sheldon The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
__Sheldon Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
__Sheldon Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.
__Sheldon You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.
__Sheldon How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
__Sheldon I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
__Leonard Sheldon! We're working here!
__Leonard Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
__Penny Oh.
__Sheldon Do you have those little marshmallows?
__Sheldon Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn't raise her no liars.
__Sheldon Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o'clock and order the same exact thing, and it's now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?
__Leonard It's an annual science conference. We've all been invited to speak.
__Amy No, we discussed it. We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.
__Howard Really? You want to see the keynote?
__Bernadette Really? And miss the keynote?
__Howard We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.
__Amy Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
__Howard What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.
__Glenn Great to see you!
__Howard Yeah, let's go with that.
__Penny Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
__Howard How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
__Penny I think it's the only way to look at it.
__Penny Forget it.
__Sheldon All right.
__Sheldon Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I'll never understand that boy. But then again, I'm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.
__Raj No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.
__Leonard More than this?
__Seibert Mrs. Latham, I'd like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
__Leonard Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
__Mrs Latham They're cute when they're about to wet themselves, aren't they? I'll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?
__Amy Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.
__Leonard Oh. Then what was last night about?
__Sheldon She stiffed you?
__Sheldon That's a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn't learn anything from his relationship with you.
__Seibert Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know.
__Leonard Uh, sure. Why?
__Leonard No.
__Howard I don't know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette.
__Howard That's not really necessary.
__Sheldon Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman's father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
__Howard Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I'll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.
__Howard Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?
__Amy What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.
__Amy So, you feeling better?
__Amy Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.
__Sheldon Because we don't throw parties.
__Sheldon The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?
__Leonard Oh, sounds great.
__Penny Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
__Sheldon We had a good run, you and I.
__Penny Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
__Sheldon Yes, please. Your girlfriend's a little short-tempered.
__Priya Yeah, just because you're in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?
__Howard So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
__Howard Fine. Get another deck and I'll do the trick with that.
__Howard I'm saying believe in magic, you muggle.
__Penny Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.
__Priya So did you get to talk to Penny?
__Sheldon I'm reverse engineering Wolowitz's magic trick.
__Priya No, he did not.
__Howard I'll show you one more time. Raj?
__Sheldon What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.
__Howard Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
__Bernadette Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm never speaking to Priya again.
__Sheldon Excellent! It's in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
__Raj Oh, come on, man. Bros before… my sister.
__Raj Oh, guess who.
__Leonard Okay, let's get clear on something. We're just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one's bat'lething anybody.
__Sheldon Now I'm thinking about Jell-O.
__Howard Oh, great. It's my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what'd you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat's fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It's one of the reasons I love her.
__Leonard Man, he's going to be blindsided.
__Sheldon Oh, I'm back to trains. Woo-woo.
__Amy Then we'll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.
__Amy Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
__Amy Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
__Priya A good question, Howard. Turns out you can't. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?
__Penny Okay, suit yourself. We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.
__Sheldon No, thank you, but for the record, I'm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.
__Sheldon Oh, good, you're up. I've written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I'd like you to sign it.
__Bernadette Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
__Bernadette I don't want anything in my ample bosom.
__Amy I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It's the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
__Sheldon All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don't see that catching on at all.
__Sheldon It's three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
__Sheldon Fascinating. What's in it?
__Bernadette You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that. I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
__Amy Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What's the problem?
__Bernadette I don't know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy's stupid astronaut story!
__Priya You've been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?
__Bernadette I know. But if she orders something low-fat I'll totally give her the full-fat version.
__Leonard My water. You're drinking it.
__Sheldon Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
__Howard Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?
__Howard That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.
__Mrs Wolowitz I hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!
__Sheldon A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack.
__Howard Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.
__Howard It's not important.
__Penny Yeah, tell me about it.
__Leonard I don't care. I don't have anything to hide.
__Sheldon Oh, congratulations.
__Amy It's indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.
__Amy I'll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?
__Sheldon Rotating.
__Raj Scotty, I need more power.
__Leonard We tried. She doesn't get along with Sheldon.
__Penny Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
__Sheldon The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
__Raj I'm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
__Leonard Sorry.
__Leonard You're moving back to India?
__Mrs Koothrappali Why are you lying to us?
__Raj Hey.
__Raj Why do you care so much? You're dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.
__Leonard I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.
__Dr Hofstadter Hello, dear.
__Leonard What's going on? What do you want?
__Penny I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.
__Penny Yeah.
__Priya I miss you.
__Penny I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
__Sheldon You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
__Leonard Okay, so I, I, I guess I'll just jump right in.
__Priya Oh, Leonard, listen…
__Howard First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they're all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.
__Bernadette Take me home now.
__Amy I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.
__Leonard That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
__Amy I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now, you don't hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.
__Bernadette No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother's been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
__Penny Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
__Howard Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.
__Sheldon Because you don't have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game's in serious trouble.
__Penny Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
__Sheldon That's the great thing. It doesn't matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
__Howard Okay.
__Leonard You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
__Dr Koothrappali Hah. You're an idiot. Love doesn't last. Well, he's going to find out eventually. Think about it.
__Leonard Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
__Leonard Hang on. Can you do any better?
__Wil Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
__Sheldon Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.
__Penny Wait, what is going on?
__Bernadette I always catch your drift.
__Howard This isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
__Howard I'm sorry. You're right. Okay, let's try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.
__Leonard For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
__Howard I love you, too. So, sex now?
__Penny Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?
__Bernadette Oh, God, you're right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
__Bernadette I know.
__Sheldon Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!
__Sheldon You've already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.
__Leonard Uh, yeah, it's Raj's sister. It's kind of tough. She's in India. Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.
__Leonard Please pester her. Please, for me.
__Sheldon Offer them a hot beverage.
__Mrs Cooper The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.
__Mrs Cooper Well, then you are going to stand there all day.
__Mrs Cooper I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.
__Leonard I hadn't…
__Mrs Cooper Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.
__Sheldon Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you've forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I'm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.
__Sheldon Stop talking like that. You've been rendered speechless by fear.
__Sheldon I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.
__Penny Yeah, probably.
__Penny Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?
__Sheldon Well, if it's of any help, I've read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.
__Leonard Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
__Sheldon Oh, no! I can't!
__Howard Please, we're eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?
__Leonard Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
__Sheldon Where are you going?
__Amy That's not necessary, it's like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.
__ the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.
__Sheldon Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman. They are a handful.
__Leonard Hi, Amy.
__Penny No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.
__Bernadette I love it!
__Leonard I know, it's high-resolution sadness.
__Sheldon Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.  Go away, bird.
__Leonard Sheldon, just ignore him.
__Sheldon Quick, what does a hawk sound like?
__Leonard Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?
__Howard All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.
__Penny Uh, no, thanks.
__Penny What you writing there?
__Bernadette Oh, he's a sweetie.
__Leonard Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
__Amy Sheldon, I'm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you're entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.
__Howard A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid.
__Amy I don't know. He's nice. He's funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That's kind of hot.
__Penny You're not the guy.
__Amy What's that?
__Leonard Yeah, it's “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
__Penny Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
__Amy Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
__Penny Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.
__Penny What? I was not a bully.
__Jimmy How the hell should I know? That's why I need a nerd.
__Jimmy What's this word?
__Bernadette What about helping people?
__Sheldon One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
__Jimmy You mind if I use your bathroom?
__Jimmy What apology?
__Leonard Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.
__Raj Can't you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?
__Sheldon It's appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favour.
__Second child It's a fake pitcher.
__Bernadette Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don't want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn't the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let's see how you like this waffle!
__Howard I don't know. I can't see a life where I don't have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
__Sheldon I told you.
__Amy If he were dying, would you sleep with him?
__Sheldon All right, then. The reason you're fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she's the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.
__Leonard See you later.
__Penny Yeah?
__Leonard Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
__Penny You are so funny.
__Sheldon Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he's being murdered. Now, back to our game.
__Leonard Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
__Sheldon After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?
__Leonard I don't want beef jerky.
__Bernadette Oh, that's nice.
__ Penny?
__Leonard Me, too, I missed you.
__Penny You see me all the time. You sure you just don't miss the sex?
__Amy What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
__Raj You have a beautiful voice.
__Raj I bet it is. Why don't women like me?
__Raj I'm sorry?
__Leonard I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
__Sheldon Not necessary. No. I found a service that'll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.
__Sheldon Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We're in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.
__Leonard So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?
__Howard Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don't bother me!
__Sheldon Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a  Okay. No, no. I'll start over. Professor
__Sheldon I'm sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what's under the blanket, you tell him it's some lobster traps.
__Penny Why wouldn't you?
__Amy Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.
__Amy Soap spots. Wash 'em again.
__Penny You and Amy? Good?
__Amy That's not an apology.
__Sheldon This is not your office. It hasn't been assigned yet.
__Leonard No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
__Leonard Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
__Raj I'm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.
__Amy I'm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.
__Barber I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital. He's pretty sick.
__Leonard When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
__Howard I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.
__Sheldon Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
__Penny All right, honey, look, we've known each other for a long time now, right? I've taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you're sick, you've even saw me naked once.
__Leonard It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
__Sheldon Oh, it's not your fault. I've been to the model train store. I've been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.
__Bernadette Pew!
__Raj Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.
__Amy Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.
__Penny Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
__Sheldon That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
__Penny Oh.
__Leonard Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.
__Raj ‘Cause I, I'm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I'd like you to help me find uh, a wife.
__Raj It's different. You're people don't worship lox.
__Howard Nice to meet you.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.
__Spock If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?
__Raj We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she's a lesbian.
__Penny I dunno. I just think it's a waste.  Relax. I'm just looking at the box.
__Penny What is the truth?
__Howard I told you, no.
__Howard No, you said, would it help if I said I'm sorry?
__Sheldon Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.
__Raj Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn't believe in to end his life quickly.
__Howard But in exchange, I'd like you to do a few things for me.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Sheldon I'm not sure how to do this.
__Leonard What are these?
__Howard All right, Sheldon, there's only one thing left I want you to do. Don't worry, it's an easy one.
__Howard No, about my job. I want you to tell me I'm good at what I do.
__All To Howard.
__Amy I'm curious what's bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?
__Penny Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.
__Bernadette Okay.
__Penny No, you're not.
__Leonard You must be burning up.
__Sheldon Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
__Mr. Rostenkowski Yeah, so?
__Howard But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
__Penny Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too.
__Howard I changed my mind. I don't want to do this.
__Cosmonaut You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?
__Amy No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.
__Sheldon Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.
__Bernadette So, what do you say, Amy?
__Bernadette Oh, no.
__Dimitri Okay, I'm going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.
__Bernadette Not now, Dad.
__Mr Rostenkowski Like that guy could catch a football.
__Sheldon I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
__Amy Well, I'm ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.
__Leonard This is it.
__Raj Yoo-hoo! Over here!
__Howard What do you want, Ma?
__Howard Ma…
__Howard Okay, okay.
__Raj I'm just saying that after everything you've been through, you get to look into each other's eyes and say “I love you.” And that's beautiful.
__Stuart Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
__Amy Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don't tell Sheldon. He's still a flight risk.
__Sheldon That's mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
__Stuart All right.
__Amy Just watch the movie.
__Sheldon Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
__Sheldon Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.
__Leonard Okay, I think I understand.
__Sheldon Are you sleeping?
__Sheldon Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I'm a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
__Sheldon Homeostasis refers to a system's ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
__Penny That is the last thing I want to do.
__Howard Great, I'll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.
__Bernadette I got to get back to work. I love you.
__Penny August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?
__Sheldon I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
__Sheldon Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.
__Raj Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.
__Howard Okay, okay. What am I doing? I'm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you'll never have sex with another man.
__Sheldon Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?
__Alex You're very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.
__Howard Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don't have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
__Raj Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard's final descent has begun.
__Bernadette I am now that you're back. Come on, let's go home so I can tear off those little pants.
__Sheldon I know.
__Penny Okay. Ready, set, go.
__Penny Present! Yeah!
__Leonard No.
__Raj So you're wandering all around by yourself? That's not the kind of hero's welcome an astronaut should come home to.
__Howard Wow, so you guys are like buds now?
__Howard You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.
__Bernadette Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we're going.
__Bernadette I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
__Penny Yeah, I'm not really clear on what that means.
__Leonard Sign right there.
__Leonard That is a pencil sharpener.
__Leonard Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  just be information  on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.  So it's possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.
__Bernadette There's a book under here.
__Leonard Oh. That's great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?
__Leonard Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.
__Leonard Okay, I get it.
__Sheldon Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.
__Amy Understood.
__Amy Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth. Let's try it again. Everybody's having fun. And action.
__Amy Cut.
__Bernadette You ready to go?
__Howard There's some underwear in the hamper.
__Leonard Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.
__Sheldon Penny, please, I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.
__Penny You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
__Sheldon I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I'm doing.
__Bernadette That's a lot for a kid to deal with.
__Howard You know, she's why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she'd smile. For a few minutes, she'd forget how lonely she was.
__Leonard Oh, that's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
__Raj We just told you.
__Howard What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
__Sheldon Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.
__Leonard I liked it better when you thought I wasn't here.
__Sheldon I thought you left a long time ago.
__Leonard Oh. You know, I'm really starting to not like this guy.
__Raj Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.
__Sheldon Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It's exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.
__Sheldon That's my parking spot.
__Sheldon I don't want another parking space. I want my parking space. It's perfect. It's a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It's a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.
__Sheldon Well, I'm not giving it away.
__Sheldon He's in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.
__Howard He wasn't using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
__Amy Why not?
__Howard Get out of my spot.
__Amy I have to say, I'm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.
__Sheldon Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.
__Bernadette So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?
__Howard You know, the thing.
__Raj If you don't want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I'll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.
__Leonard I'm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.
__Penny Oh, look, it's a female. You can see all the eggs.
__Leonard Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.
__Sheldon Actually that helps, thank you.
__Bernadette No!
__Sheldon Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay 'round about, deep and crisp and even
__Penny Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
__Amy You think that's bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.
__Amy I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.
__Amy I do. And don't worry, someday you'll have somebody, too.
__Sheldon Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it's probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.
__Raj I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
__Penny What is happening?
__Penny What? He's loving it?
__Leonard Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
__Leonard Of course not. No. Why?
__Leonard I don't know.
__HR Woman Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it's been a while.
__Alex Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
__ Credits sequence.
__Bernadette When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom's pants out.
__Raj You know, we're not that far from Vazquez Rocks.
__GPS Recalculating. While we're waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.
__Stuart Well, uh, let's see. You've got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
__Sheldon Mr. Data's weapon is his mind. I'm wielding it.
__Penny Wait, I thought we were reading.
__Bernadette Hold on, who decides who's worthy? Does the hammer decide?
__Sheldon I'll eat later. Right now, I'm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.
__Kripke Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other's work, meet again tomowow?
__Howard Get that waste of money out of my face.
__Amy How's that?
__Howard Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
__Howard I thought you might.
__Sheldon That's awfully personal.
__Leonard Ow!
__Sheldon I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
__Leonard Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
__Leonard You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.
__Penny No. No, no, I do. I do. It's just, I mean, it's a really big step.
__Raj Well, I, I really couldn't. But, uh, I've had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you've had removed from your body over the years. Didn't know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.
__Raj Oh, Howard, stop.
__Raj They're on the chair, right over… Oy vey.
__Sheldon You can't live here.
__Sheldon I think I'll keep it for myself.
__Leonard Mmm, would you like some wine?
__Leonard You know what? Why don't we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine's Day?
__Penny Yes, absolutely. Now they're doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.
__Leonard Yes. It's all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.
__Nerdy guy Usually I spend Valentine's Day sad and alone. This year, I'm just sad.
__Leonard Don't look under that rock.  Raj, you okay?
__Leonard Raj, what's going on?
__Amy Because she's your friend, and she did a nice job. I'm sure she'd like to hear it.
__Sheldon Why not?
__Sheldon Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?
__Sheldon Oh, brilliant. I've been itching to pull that trigger.
__Howard All right. Well, I'll see you around.
__Leonard You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
__Amy Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.
__Sheldon It's about streetcars? Oh, great. I won't need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)
__Girl Oh, you don't want to do that. I'm kind of broken.
__Sheldon All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it's too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
__Bernadette Joke?
__Sheldon Smart. We don't want any problems.
__Amy Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o'clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I'm going to Disneyland.
__Man You can do better.
__Raj No, never. What is porn?
__Sheldon Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don't know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it's clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?
__Leonard Disneyland. Go on, I'm listening.
__ Hey, guys, come on in.
__Howard Whoa, you opened this?
__Howard I couldn't be less interested. Now, come on, I'll take you home.
__Bermadette That works.
__Sheldon Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard's father.
__Bernadette Yeah, try doing it in heels.
__Leonard You know, too.
__Raj Couldn't leave him one friend, could you?
__Sheldon I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
__Bernadette That's nice.
__Sheldon Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
__Sheldon Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.
__Janine Good for you.
__Amy Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.
__Amy You're all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom's going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?
__Janine I could not ask you to do that.
__Howard You know what's going on, don't you?
__Howard I can't believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.
__Penny It's six thirty in the morning.
__Amy I'm sorry you're upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.
__Sheldon Doesn't matter, does it?
__Sheldon Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
__Leonard What?
__Howard Yeah, that's what I was doing.
__Leonard Mr. Jeffries, I'm, I'm Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
__Arthur You're the genius.
__Penny See, I'm not a scientist like them.
__Arthur No, she, she's the only reason I've, I've stayed this long.
__Sheldon 14:11,446
__Penny Arthur, are you okay?
__Sheldon Name it.
__Arthur Or a Korean family in Alhambra.
__Sheldon Yeah, yeah, we'll be right there. Leonard?
__Sheldon As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.
__Raj What else have you been thinking about doing?
__Sheldon I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.
__Sheldon That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
__Raj Okay, if I upset you, then why didn't you just say something?
__Leonard All right, Amy, it's your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.
__Together Ooh!
__Sheldon And now what?
__Sheldon I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off.
__Amy Keep rolling.
__Sheldon Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.
__Sheldon Well, now, but do you think that's a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
__Lucy Did he take the T-shirt to space?
__Raj You are, but you've got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.
__Howard I'm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that's really something.
__Howard Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
__Sheldon Well, I mean it. I'm really happy for you. And that's how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
__Howard Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.
__Amy You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.
__Everybody Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!
__Amy No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.
__Bernadette Thanks.
__Raj Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I'll tell you about it.
__Sheldon All right. In 4D chess…
__Penny No. Come on, let's talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don't know.
__Sheldon And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you're going for. Okay, here's one I thought I'd take to the grave.
__Penny Oh, my God. You weren't supposed to be here till Sunday.
__Howard original and Lohan. You're an idiot.
__Leonard And, oh, that's me getting rescued after I fell in.
__Sheldon That's odd.
__Penny Okay. Look, honey, I promise there's no one's here. I‘ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.
__Howard You're kidding, right? I mean, you know I'm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
__Howard ‘Cause we've got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn't take into account the square footage of her back.
__Howard I don't know. Few weeks. Why?
__Bernadette Howie, the oestrogen's getting absorbed by your skin. That's why you've been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass.
__Leonard I'm going to work. You can come if you want.
__Leonard No, I don't.
__Amy Really?
__Leonard Keep your voice down.
__Sheldon Oh, Penny, I see you've ordered pizza. I have Chinese food.
__Penny No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet's been doing that. I called the building manager, so…
__Howard You're full of oestrogen and you don't act like that.
__Howard Come on, Raj, it's a yes or no question.
__Raj Yay.
__Leonard Where do you think I would take you?
__Sheldon Thought I heard you out here.
__Sheldon Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
__Howard Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry.
__Howard Hallelujah.
__Amy Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?
__Amy Yes, it's not a ruse to make fun of me. It's a real game and I'm winning it.
__Bernadette Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I'm in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.
__Howard That's it.
__Penny Let's go.
__Leonard It's just a bunch of pants.
__Sheldon Hey, that's my shirt.
__Raj Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don't you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.
__Raj Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.
__Howard Cherry
__Penny Well, why were you so angry?
__Penny Hey, what's going on with you?
__Bernadette And I'm not buying it. Try again.
__Howard I'm learning to be a man in a culture where it's increasingly difficult to know how?
__Mrs Hofstadter Hello, Leonard.
__Stuart And make them look us in the eye.
__Sheldon That's true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
__Sheldon Oh, no, I got bored with that. I'm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.
__Amy I'm relieved that you don't have a problem with us working together.
__Sheldon Howard, if you're going to lie to your wife, don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That's a dead giveaway.
__Raj His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
__Amy Sheldon.
__Sheldon Bleugh!
__Penny Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?
__Howard You got the tropical fruit kind?
__Bernadette It's just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
__Raj It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.
__Sheldon I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?
__Howard Sorry we're so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
__Sheldon Did I? Well, that can't be right. No one's ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…
__Raj As I'm sure you're aware, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his…
__Amy Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.
__Howard I'm getting worried about Bernadette. I'm gonna call and check on her.
__Amy Poor Bernadette.
__Leonard Nothing. I love it.
__Raj Actually, I'm busy.
__Sheldon That's even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
__Amy Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn't want you to read his paper?
__Sheldon Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.
__Howard Oh, that's actually pretty nice.
__Sheldon No, no, now that we've cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.
__Sheldon Well, then, I'll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it's promising and he's going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you're a washed-up has-been. Or dead.
__Arthur Good night.
__Arthur Yeah.
__Arthur You, you know you're describing a dog.
__Raj My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
__Raj There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won't make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.
__Sheldon Actually, I don't need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.
__Lucy Oh, I don't know. I guess I thought it would be easier.
__Penny Sheldon's not here. Why don't you take the sweater off?
__Leonard No, it's, it's almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.
__Raj I don't believe you, you're lying to me.
__Sheldon Yes. Like we're on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
__Penny Oh, sorry. We'll keep it down.
__Raj My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.
__Mike I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.
__Howard I never had a beer with my dad, either.
__Raj Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
__Amy I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he's not looking.
__Bernadette Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I'll be back in like five, ten minutes.
__Penny Okay.
__Zack Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.
__Mike I don't know what's scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.
__Amy All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.
__Sheldon Now, how's about you get us a couple of beers?
__Leonard Hey, you're in a good mood.
__Howard I don't want coffee.
__Raj Hang on.
__Barry It's a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn't your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.
__Sheldon Fine.
__Leonard Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
__Raj If you were having Sheldon's baby would you really want him in the room?
__Leonard You guys are making me nervous.
__ End fantasy sequence.
__Sheldon Doesn't matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It's some kind of dirty magic show.
__ Okay, that's enough.
__ Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there's tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me.
__Amy Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where'd I go?
__Sheldon I would've preferred to have you there with me.
__Amy Oh.
__Fat Leonard Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.
__Sheldon Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they're German, 'cause that's a tough crowd.
__Bernadette Or maybe just stop talking.
__Leonard How you doing?
__Leonard Right.
__Penny How could you say that?
__Penny And you didn't get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn't get your part cut!
__Leonard Hey. Can we talk?
__Raj That's a mirror.
__Sheldon You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.
__Leonard Okay, listen, I don't mean to diminish what you're going through, but I'm a little distracted right now.
__Sheldon No. I was just tricking you.
__Stuart Oh. What's the hurry?
__Stuart Well, I'll do what I can, but I can't make any promises.
__Amy Hey, what brings you guys here?
__Amy That's okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.
__Penny You okay?
__Sheldon Leonard told me to stay.
__Raj Well, do you support this?
__Leonard And I support you.
__Penny Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
__Bert Yeah.
__Bernadette Not from you. Let's go, Stuart.
__Penny Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?
__Penny Look, I know you think I'm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.
__Leonard Sunday's gone.
__Howard Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.
__Sheldon I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You're gonna feel pretty silly when we're 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.
__Raj I'm just saying, we don't know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?
__Bernadette Should we leave?
__Amy Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.
__Howard Do what?
__Raj You know I struggle with Batman.
__Leonard Name one.
__Howard Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
__Sheldon Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.
__Amy Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I'm sure they're having more fun than we are.
__Leonard Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It's a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it's all for laughs.
__Penny No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That's really bad for dogs.
__Penny A whole box.
__Leonard Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me.
__Vet Got it. Should have been a dentist.
__Waiter Better than you think.
__Bernadette Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200
__ I'm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
__Leonard How's she doing?
__Leonard Moo-stache.
__Penny No, no, no, stay there. I'm fine on the floor.
__Sheldon Wait. Is this really worth it? We've lived together for years with nary an argument.
__Howard Okay. Thank you. We'll be in touch. You're not gonna believe this.
__Raj And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I'm just kidding. We'll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.
__Sheldon No. No, I've changed. Like the frog who's put in a pot of water that's heated so gradually he doesn't realize he's boiling to death.
__Raj Do you think this is cool?
__Bernadette Hi, honey.
__Howard Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.
__Mrs Wolowitz For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That's what happened to your Aunt Ida.
__Sheldon How about Penny's depressing acting career?
__Penny Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape's DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
__Sheldon I wasn't referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.
__Amy Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.
__Amy Oh. Let me guess. There's an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
__Raj Teams are fun.
__Howard Will you please sto…
__Amy No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we're both hardcore into quilting.
__Sheldon Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.
__Howard Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.
__Leonard I know. I thought we'd take yours.
__Leonard What do you mean it's too late?
__Sheldon No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
__Raj Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.
__Leonard Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we'd really drift apart if we both became successful?
__Penny Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn't need the money.
__Leonard Well, you don't go into science for the money.
__Sheldon Who was he?
__Mrs Cooper A few months.
__Sheldon Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas.
__Penny You do?
__Sheldon No. I'm not sure how we're going to get past this.
__Howard Well, let's just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she's basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.
__Sheldon I am.
__Mrs Cooper Shelly, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.
__Penny Yeah, me, too.
__Sheldon Seriously. I feel like I've got a fish tank in my pelvis.
__Bernadette Well, there's this lady in our office who's retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.
__Amy Oh, my gosh.
__Howard Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
__Emily Thanks. I love that jacket.
__Raj Yeah, but now you make me wonder what's wrong with you.
__Amy Let's get you some food. You, You'll feel better after you eat.
__Penny Oh, come on, try me.
__Penny I gave him a new look. It's cute, huh?
__Emily It's fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.
__Bernadette Where are you going?
__Leonard It's sweet that he thinks there's a story.
__Leonard No.
__Howard Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.
__Sheldon My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
__Leonard Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.
__Sheldon For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.
__Penny Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.
__Raj Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren't my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.
__Raj And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.
__Penny Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?
__Sheldon Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?
__Leonard He was 84, he'd say where's my pudding?
__Penny I feel like I want to cry.
__Penny No, I'm dry. You're a big crybaby, you start, I'll join in.
__Howard I think he's taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
__Howard Obviously.
__Leonard I just thought of one more.
__Penny Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
__Sheldon When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
__Man Hey, should we get our seats?
__Raj Sorry, I left them in my turban.
__Raj Maybe. I, I don't know.It's late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you're saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.
__Howard Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I'm nice, I want to take care of people.
__Howard Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
__Raj Well, me, neither.
__Raj I don't. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
__Leonard Oh. Then I guess I'm in.
__Penny Really? You guess you're in?
__Foreign Nurse Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!
__Howard You know, if you're really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.
__Mrs Hofstadter In any event, while I've had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she's good enough for me.
__Bernadette Sorry I'm late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
__Leonard Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.
__Sheldon Ugh, it's like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.
__Penny Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
__Penny You do that?
__Leonard Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.
__Sheldon Good Lord. Padawan's the student, not the teacher.
__Bernadette This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos 'cause they're about to go bad, you're just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.
__Bernadette It's too late to cancel. You're going.
__Raj ‘Cause that's what little matzo balls do.
__Dan Wll, she is. I didn't even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.
__Stuart I didn't say I was your father.
__Amy See? This trip was good for you.
__Penny Next Monday.
__Amy I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.
__Bernadette It's driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.
__Sheldon No one signed up.
__Leonard Well, that's not your fault.
__Leonard What?
__Penny Uh, no. I can keep going.
__All together The Rhombicosidodecahedron.
__Penny I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.
__Sheldon Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.
__Amy Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
__Bernadette Okay.
__Bernadette I think so.
__Leonard Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.
__Bernadette Long story short, they have seven HBOs.
__Amy I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.
__Raj You know, he might not reopen. He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.
__Penny How? You can't force someone to like you.
__Leonard Will you stay out of this?
__Leonard Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store. Is that okay?
__Bernadette Okay, let's get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.
__Howard Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
__Raj Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
__Howard You admit Amy's a distraction?
__Amy Great.
__Bernadette That sucks.
__Sheldon Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?
__Leonard Had will have placed?
__Sheldon Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn't be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…
__Bernadette We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
__Penny And I really appreciate it, but now I don't need it, so here you go.
__Leonard Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.
__Sheldon Very well.
__Penny Ugh, You're right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.
__Raj Did you get in?
__Raj Let's set up the equipment. It'll help take your mind off of it.
__Leonard She made him a chore chart.
__Raj But you're okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
__Penny Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.
__Raj Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.
__Sheldon Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
__Howard I want that, too.
__Bernadette Oh.
__Penny Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.
__Bernadette I don't know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.
__Howard We know.
__Penny Please, yes.
__Leonard All right, I'll get rid of him. But you owe me one.
__Raj Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.
__Sheldon Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?
__Howard Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.
__Bernadette Right here.
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I'm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you're a little turned on.
__Raj Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.
__Penny Well, who'd you go with?
__Sheldon It's not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I'm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
__Bernadette Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.
__Sheldon Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, 'cause it's me.
__Amy Hello.
__Leonard Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal. End of story.
__Leonard I think you could give a better clue.
__Leonard Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don't die?
__Sheldon I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.
__Amy Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
__Howard And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I'm gonna chew my leg off.
__Howard Not important.
__Amy How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
__Sheldon How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
__ Fancy a dip, my dear?
__Leonard Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would've finally let him open that bottle of champagne?
__Howard Well, there's no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn't be too hard to run the numbers and check.
__Leonard Any chance you know what it is?
__Prof Sharpe Yes, he was always working on this.
__Bernadette Thank you.
__Dan Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I've been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.
__Bernadette Who's been paying for my coffee?
__Leonard Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man's entire career, and all that's left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.
__Dr Koothrappali You want me to come?
__Sheldon With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me, she'll feel terrible.
__Bernadette So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
__Sheldon That's right. So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.
__Howard Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?
__Howard How do you know it wasn't Leonard?
__Santa Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.
__Amy They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
__Leonard You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we're into.
__Sheldon I don't know why you're so surprised. If there's one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it's how to compromise.
__Penny Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You're a different woman now. You're smart, you've got great friends, you've got a boyfriend, you're pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we're gonna do whatever you want.
__Amy Basket weaving at the craft museum.
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Leonard I'm not leaving your world. I'm just talking about living across the hall.
__Leonard Everything's fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
__Sheldon Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?
__Penny Ugh!
__Penny Ugh, what?
__Sheldon But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.
__Leonard I know this isn't my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?
__Sheldon For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you're still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.
__Leonard Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?
__Sheldon My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.
__Amy No.
__Penny Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose. Besides, aren't you the one who says there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?
__Bernadette This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
__Bernadette Can you please just let it go?
__Sheldon It won't be as good.
__Sheldon Okay, babe, let's do this.
__Leonard Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?
__Howard So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you're telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?
__Leonard I'm putting the city names in the grid now. I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.
__Clerk Yes?
__Sheldon Well, I don't enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director's Cut.
__Penny All that's left to do is stare into each other's eyes for four minutes without talking.
__Sheldon No, it wasn't. Uh, now let's tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it's safe to say that you're not in love with me and I'm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.
__Amy Let's forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?
__Amy I'm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you're planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.
__Sheldon What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
__Sheldon Yep, you're mad.
__Raj Hang on.
__Howard Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
__Leonard You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
__Raj You know, it, it's bad enough that I have to deal with this…
__Raj Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.
__Bernadette She sounds really mad.
__Penny And our butts. Not hanging it.
__Sheldon Good idea. And since you've had such a rough day, I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.
__Emily That's okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.
__Amy No.
__Amy Remember that time you didn't get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
__Leonard Sheldon.
__Raj You don't want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.
__Bernadette You okay?
__Amy Do you need any help in the kitchen?
__Penny All right, hey, you two, we're here for Howard right now, okay?
__Penny Wait, who's Tor?
__Leonard Lots of people also didn't have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.
__All Yay.
__Sheldon We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.
__Howard Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
__Leonard Yes.
__Sheldon Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That's code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.
__Sheldon Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. And I just can't hide it.
__Howard I would do that.
__Howard So it's settled. The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
__Sheldon Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.
__Security Guard Who are you here to see?
__Raj We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.
__Nerdy Guy Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.
__Bernadette Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.
__Bernadette You know, Amy, I, uh, can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.
__Leonard The glass is empty, Sheldon. It's completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?
__Penny Seriously?
__Raj Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
__Raj You're in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
__Kevin Oh, I'm hanging up now.
__Josh Wow.
__Leonard Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
__Howard Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.
__Howard Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I'm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.
__Sheldon I'm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
__Sheldon Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.
__Sheldon Building on building on that, there's a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.
__Penny Yeah, it's going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.
__Howard The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
__Leonard What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba's head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.
__Penny So it's not really like that?
__Raj If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn't have to ask.
__Leonard Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?
__Penny Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.
__Howard Yes, of course.
__Sheldon Hello.
__Raj Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.
__Bernadette I have the tool you wanted.
__Stuart I put on pants.
__Sheldon Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.
__Mrs Cooper Good to see you again, dear.
__Mrs Cooper Stay out of this.
__Dr Hofstadter But look how well you turned out.
__ Credits sequence.
__Leonard Hey.
__Howard How are you saying that with a straight face?
__Penny No. Sheldon, we're getting married.
__Sheldon Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.
__Penny Fine. I want to release butterflies.
__Leonard Are you saying you want to get married?
__Penny Yeah.
__Penny Why are you telling me this now?
__Penny Really? Because to me, it seems like we're about to get married and you're trying to sabotage it.
__Amy Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
__Leonard Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.
__Amy I said I needed time to think.
__Leonard Yes.
__Leonard Yeah.
__ Official  …symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.
__Stuart Exactly.
__Penny I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.
__Leonard Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.
__Sheldon Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I'll just have a salad. You know? Where's my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.
__Sheldon Really? I never imagined it any other way.
__Sheldon I'm currently single.
__Raj And you knew about this this whole time?
__Amy It's Penny's.
__Penny Hi.
__Penny You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.
__Leonard Are we done?
__Leonard Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
__Mandy Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?
__Howard Actually, we're not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.
__Raj This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.
__Howard Okay, calm down. There's a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.
__Penny Oh, it's good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.
__Bernadette We'll take you to the mall to get it done.
__Penny Why? I can do it right here.
__Howard Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.
__Penny Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad's not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I'll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
__Amy Well, it's kind of sad that they don't know. I mean, they love Leonard.
__Penny When?
__Sheldon Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.
__Penny No. He was a beloved member of the family.
__Raj I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
__Howard Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
__Leonard Do I really have to do that now?
__Amy I don't know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.
__Sheldon No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional. And since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.
__Raj Cute? It's not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
__Raj Yeah, so what?
__Barry Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you're not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.
__Howard Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
__Sheldon Right. Always right.
__Raj My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
__Leonard Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.
__Bernadette What did he say?
__Leonard What are we going to do?
__Leonard I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.
__Leonard Who is he?
__Bernadette We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing what's out there.
__Leonard What?
__Amy No, no, stop reading that.
__All Amy/What?/Can't believe it/Oh, my God.
__Barry Take your time. I'll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.
__Raj Hmm. I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.
__Sheldon Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
__Penny Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.
__Howard May I say something?
__Raj Well, it's easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.
__Sheldon Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
__Sheldon No, not at all. No, I'm fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.
__Howard I don't know why she's lying to you. She's the one who doesn't want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…
__Raj It's interesting your father didn't help around the house and Howard doesn't help, either, so in a way, Howard's not only like your father, but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.
__Bernadette Okay, I'll think about it.
__Spock Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic.
__Howard Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You're crazy.
__Sheldon And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
__Leonard By stalking them?
__Dave Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?
__Penny Oh, no.
__Dave Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.
__Sheldon One minute is a long time.
__Raj Forty-five.
__Girl Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I've never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.
__Sheldon Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.
__Emily Are you and I close enough for me to say…
__Soup Kitchen Manager I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.
__Leonard It's just the four digits, month and day.
__Howard Huh. Okay, I'll try it.
__Leonard I didn't even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
__Leonard Well, you didn't read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.
__Howard Sorry. It's just, you're you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.
__Sheldon I'll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.
__Amy It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.
__Penny Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
__Sheldon I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.
__Raj They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
__Howard We did raise the roof that night.
__Leonard What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.
__Bernadette Who's Trent?
__Raj Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?
__Penny Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.
__Leonard Aw.
__Arthur And they, they, they don't wear underwear.
__Sheldon I'll, I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.
__Leonard Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?
__Bernadette Well, we're really happy for you, and we know how much he cares…
__Leonard We will.
__Sheldon Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.
__Sheldon I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.
__Sheldon Why?
__Sheldon I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
__Sheldon Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.
__Howard What kind of doctor is she?
__Penny Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
__Leonard That's just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
__Leonard What if I get caught?
__Howard Spineless.
__Bernadette Our pleasure.
__Sheldon It is kind of cute.
__Penny Hey, how'd it go?
__Penny Uh, do you have any questions?
__Penny I don't wanna.
__Sheldon Even the girls.
__Penny Okay, if you think it'll help. Oh, just don't make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.
__Bernadette We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
__Howard No.
__Leonard Well, Vegas, but…
__Amy I said what's new, but sure.
__Sheldon Hey, we're both great at this.
__Sheldon The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.
__Raj Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.
__Penny If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.
__Raj You know, Sheldon…
__Leonard Oh, that's nice. Most people her age don't embrace technology.
__Sheldon You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'. There's Amy. I just know you're gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.
__Leonard Did it?
__Penny Come in.
__Claire Great. I'll text you.
__ And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.
__Howard You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don't you just do it already?
__Amy What do you mean?
__Leonard A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
__Leonard I'm sorry. You're pretty, I'm stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?
__Maitre d' Maitre d': With all due respect, ma'am, there's nothing I can do.
__Howard Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you're a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.
__Sheldon Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn't good for us.
__Amy And a lovely Valentine's Day.
__Leonard Hey.
__Penny Don't say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?
__Howard Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?
__Howard You're right, it is, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
__Leonard There's no reason you can't.
__Sheldon Excuse me. Hey, how you doin'?
__Penny And whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.
__Amy Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?
__Sheldon Nah, she's a good kid.
__Amy Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
__Howard Thank you.
__Howard I'm sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I'm done being scared.
__Howard I love you. Mmm. And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
__Penny You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.
__Stuart Oh, yeah. Won't take the bus. He won't pack his own lunch. Won't let you spend the night on his couch.
__Adam There's another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.
__Leonard Sure.
__Wil Sheldon, I know that we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.
__Leonard Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.
__Howard Oh, I don't think there will be.
__Leonard Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?
__Bernadette A little. And it doesn't help that I've got this heightened sense of smell.
__Bernadette You don't think she'd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?
__Amy She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.
__Amy Ooh, let's find out.
__Raj I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.
__Sheldon I'll say it looks good. It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.
__Sheldon Excuse me. I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don't need one now.
__Raj Hi. I'm good. Really good. Well, I don't know why I said really good. I'm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.
__Leonard Howard, what do you think?
__Sheldon What? I didn't sign it yet.
__Amy Get a new computer.
__Leonard Hey. What are you doing here?
__Penny Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
__Sheldon You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
__Sheldon Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.
__Sheldon We'd have to take your car.
__Leonard I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she'll have a coin collection.
__Bernadette I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
__Howard It's not a problem.
__Raj I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
__Raj No, ma'am.
__Raj I love it, I'll be all like, busted, and they'll be like, what? And then we'll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't make out with me, either.
__Amy Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?
__Raj No spoilers. No spoilers.
__Raj Yes.
__Sheldon Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.
__Penny I'll see if it's available.
__Sheldon Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
__Howard And you're not concerned he's acting like somehow this is his kid, too?
__Howard Astronauts saw him carrying that.
__Penny Got it.
__Leonard Okay, I'll go. Never have I ever been arrested.
__Raj Wow.
__Bernadette Isn't that the best?
__Raj But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
__Penny What is the problem?
__Penny Well, I will still come to your meeting.
__Sheldon Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.
__Raj How could you say that?
__Sheldon I love Lisa Simpson.
__Amy Sorry.
__Raj Okay, I think I see what's happening here. You're jealous of me.
__Sheldon She did.
__Bernadette He's gonna be okay.
__Leonard Who's Frank and Alicia?
__Claire Sure, I guess. If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.
__Claire Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don't like me? What if they like me and I don't like them?
__Bernadette Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
__Sheldon He wants to see I.D.
__Penny We didn't.
__Leonard Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.
__Sheldon All right, back to learning.
__Raj Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.
__Howard Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
__Penny Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?
__Sheldon Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
__Sheldon Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.
__Raj Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.
__Leonard Hey, how'd it go?
__Howard Five.
__Sheldon Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that's straight is a line that's great.
__Bernadette Do I think he'd be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he's alone in the bathroom.
__Beverly Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?
__Man The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.
__Penny Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?
__Beverly He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.
__Sheldon You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.
__Sheldon Excuse me, I take care of him.
__Bernadette Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.
__Leonard Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.
__Howard One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.
__Alfred Oh. I, I didn't mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.
__Alfred You're welcome.
__Leonard Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.
__Sheldon See, that's funny because…
__Sheldon I think it's pretty obvious. They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.
__Penny Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.
__Leonard Well, nothing happened, right? It's over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.
__Alfred And why wouldn't we?
__Randall It's called getting caught, Mother.
__Raj Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.
__Together No.
__Alfred Sigh louder, no one heard you.
__Amy It's happening.
__Bernadette He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
__Leonard Are you crazy? You can't put that on Snapchat.
__Penny Is that really what's important right now?
__Bernadette It had to be Barbara. I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
__Leonard Yes.
__Howard No.
__Amy I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
__Penny Does he even like lemon bars?
__Penny Okay. Never mind.
__Penny Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She wasn't ready for them to know.
__Penny Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
__Raj And you just let him?
__Howard No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.
__Bernadette Got a minute?
__Sheldon I know, I was there.
__Raj So, what should we do today?
__The Flash You look tired. Why don't you have an energy drink? Everyone's doing it.
__The Flash All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.
__Penny Wait, what do you mean she's her?
__Amy I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.
__Howard Why don't you just go home?
__Leonard What?
__Sheldon That's a craving. That's a sign of chemical dependency.
__Leonard You don't.
__Raj No.
__Penny Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?
__Raj Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
__Raj What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.
__ I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.
__Amy Shall we?
__Amy Okay, I'll take that side.
__Penny Yeah, get it, girl.
__Penny Even more not what you think.
__Penny Can't.
__Penny Believe me, we know what you're going through.
__Amy What?
__Bernadette Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
__Bernadette Wait, I have my iPad.
__Howard Is that the hot tub?
__Raj Answer the question, what are you doing here?
__Stuart Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience. You've got all your lady friends, and…
__Leonard Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?
__Sheldon Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
__Penny Okay.
__Raj Why?
__Amy Oh, hi. Hi.
__ Credits sequence.
__Amy I'm sorry I mentioned it.
__Raj Then again, he did think you were my husband.
__Bert I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
__Sheldon She's learning English from TV.
__Jeff I even have a screen grab on my phone.
__Penny Well, go ahead. He's right over there.
__Stuart I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.
__Sheldon You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without 'em.
__Amy Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?
__Leonard Are you kidding me?
__Amy You stop that.
__Leonard You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing?
__Leonard But you won't be living here.
__Sheldon Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing?
__Sheldon Yes.
__Sheldon Apparently, figure this out on my own 'cause you guys are no help at all.
__Sheldon Really?
__Penny All right, fine, don't tell us.
__Sheldon Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who's on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.
__Amy Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.
__Raj That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?
__Leonard Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two.
__Howard Hey! I saw your car… Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
__Isabella You're very persistent.
__Sheldon You know, I'm not sure. You know, you'd have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again.
__Amy What about me and Sheldon?
__Hawking Don't worry, I know how you feel. I have never won a Nobel Prize.
__Sheldon I can't. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in.
__Sheldon Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.
__Penny Amy wants me to have it.
__Howard When would you move in?
__Stuart You guys relax, I'll get it. Have some bread while it's still warm.
__Stuart Oh, okay. Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.
__Sheldon If it's like your 3-D chess game, then you're out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.
__Stuart You just kick back and relax, I've got it all under control.
__Leonard Well, I'd like that, too.
__Raj I'll do it.
__Midwife It's okay. This little one will be here before you know it. Do we know what we're having?
__Penny We could go to a bar.
__Raj You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
__Sheldon Oh, don't be. You were like a foxy tea kettle.
__Sheldon Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give…
__Bernadette Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right.
__Amy I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?
__Penny Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.
__Raj You hear that, Stuart? I've got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing.
__Amy I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.
__Amy They haven't said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.
__ Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.
__Mary No. Just for the middle part. ‘Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.
__ He's been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
__Amy Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.
__Amy This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.
__ Flashback.
__Leonard Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.
__Bernadette Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.
__Penny So things started to turn around?
__Leonard Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.
__Bernadette Shh. She's asleep.
__Howard Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box, but, come on.
__Sheldon Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals and he gets time off.
__Leonard and this wine is why.
__Sheldon Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.
__Leonard No, no, no, no, let's talk about it. I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?
__Amy Bye.
__Amy I'll miss you more.
__Sheldon Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I don't see why your divorce should be any different.
__Penny Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade.
__Amy Sheldon, why don't we give them some privacy?
__Howard Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and you're there. Easy peasy, mac and… you get the idea.
__Amy Uh-huh.
__Sheldon Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
